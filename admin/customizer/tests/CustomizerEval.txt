This is my evaluation of WordPress Customizer


Things that aren't so great (things that suck!):

* Need a better way to control the 'refresh' delay.

When entering almost any value,
refresh seems to be invoked almost immediately. Somtimes this is okay (for a drop-down
or radio button selection, for example). But mostly it leads to what appear to me multiple
calls to refresh, and they seem to stack, so the refresh takes a long time. Examples of this
including adding text to a text area, changing a range value, entering a value to a box,
and even using the color picker. Ideally there would be a bit of a built in delay before
refresh is called. A half second would probably be okay, but a text box might want a bit
more time, so this probably should be settable.

* Navigation on tall panels

If any panel - a section or an option panel are tall, the user must scroll down to see
the selections on the lower part of the panel. This, unfortunately, means the panel
name box at the top that contains the < back button scrolls out of view. So, to navigate
around, the user must scroll back up before being able to go back. This is SO tedious.
