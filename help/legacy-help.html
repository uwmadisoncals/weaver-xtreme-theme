        <h2><b>Weaver Xtreme Theme Documentation -- Version 2.0</b> </h2>
        <h4>Legacy Option Interface</h4>
        <p>The Weaver WordPress theme has been one of the most popular themes
          available at WordPress.org since 2010. <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> is the
          latest generation of the Weaver theme family.</p>
        <p><em>Weaver Xtreme</em> is a major re-write of earlier versions. While
          keeping with the Weaver philosophy of giving you complete control of
          your site's design, the underlying design of <em>Weaver Xtreme</em>
          is significantly different than previous versions. If you are
          switching from an older version of Weaver, please see <a href="#switch-wii">Switching
            from Weaver II</a> for hints on how to move the the new â‰ theme</p>

        <p>Â </p>
        <p>The <em>Weaver Xtreme </em>WordPress theme represents a totally
          revised version of its predecessor, Weaver II. Almost all of the code
          that directly outputs content was completely re-written. The layout
          design is now 100% responsive, and various aspects of the design are
          now heavily oriented to responsive design. The use of px sizes is
          essentially completely gone - all size units are percent, em, or rem!
          Among other things, this means that text sizes, padding, and margins
          are now specified as a general size - small, medium, large, etc.,
          instead of using specific values. This is a much better and easier
          approach for a truly responsive site.</p>
        <p>As with previous versions,<em> Weaver Xtreme </em>allows you to
          change colors, fonts, sidebars, and other aspects of your site's look.
          In addition, it allows you to easily add whatever special code you
          might need (such as advertising tracking code), all from an easy to
          use "check mark" based theme admin page. It also has many per page and
          per post options, along with several page templates, that will allow
          you to totally customize the look of your site.</p>
        <p><em>Weaver Xtreme </em>allows you to build a custom site look by
          tweaking many of the style rules for your WordPress blog. You can get
          a customized look just by picking colors and layout options. While the
          <span class="code1">Main and Advanced Options</span> control panels
          may look overwhelming, they really aren't that hard to use once you
          play with them a bit. The different option tabs have been organized by
          the logical regions of your site. Thus, to change how the menu or info
          bar appears, go to the <span class="code1">Main Options:Menus</span>
          tab. If you want to change specifics of how posts are displayed, go to
          the<span class="code1"> Main Options:Post Specifics</span> tab. Other
          tabs are similarly organized.</p>
        <p>One key to learning how to customize your site with <em>Weaver
            Xtreme</em> is to understand how the various parts of the site are
          organized. Not surprisingly, <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> relies heavily on
          the basics of HTML &lt;div&gt;s and the "Cascading" part of CSS. Most
          of the theme options are based on this cascading layout, and organized
          accordingly. The following diagram illustrates the cascading nesting
          of the <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> design.</p>
        <p>Â  </p>
        <div style="background:white;border:1px solid black;padding:10px;">body
          <div style="background:#F8F8F8;border:1px solid red;padding:10px;">#wrapper

                  widgets<br />
                  <br />
                  6 different layouts </div>

              - footer widget area, HTML insertion, copyright line</div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <!-- body -->
        <p>The main options for the #wrapper and #container areas are found on
          the <span class="code1">Weaver Xtreme Main Options : Wrapping Areas</span>
          tab. The options for the #header are on the <em>Header</em> tab, and
          the options for the #colophon are on the <em>Footer</em> tab. Options
          for the Menus are on the Menus tab. There are two tabs to cover Page
          and Post Content: <span class="code1">Content Areas</span> and <span
            class="code1">Post
            Specifics</span>. Normally, Posts will inherit the settings from the
          Page options, but various Post specific options are available on the
          separate tab. The general layout and behavior of the content area and
          the sidebar areas is controlled by the <span class="code1">Sidebars
            &amp; Layout</span> tab. If you remember the main layout nesting
          above, and the options found on these specific tabs, you will be well
          on your way to effectively designing with <em>Weaver Xtreme</em>. </p>
        <p><em>Weaver Xtreme</em> includes its own translation files for over 20
          languages. There are about 100 visitor side messages, and it is fairly
          simple to create a <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> translation file for new
          languages. If you create your own new translation file, we would be
          happy to include it in the official <em>Weaver Xtreme</em>
          distribution.</p>
        <p>It is easy to design your own site look. You can start with one of
          many pre-defined subthemes, and change the settings to meet your
          needs. It is easy to get started: you just have to pick colors and
          click on check marks.</p>
        <p>For more advanced developers, there a many options for fine tuning.
          These include custom CSS, options to add HTML to various areas of the
          screen, and several ways to display posts in places other than the
          standard blog page.</p>

            from.</li>
          <li>Go to the <span class="code1">Main Options</span> panel. You'll
            see a list of tabs with options for the various parts of your theme
            attributes you can change. Play around with them, and see how the
            theme you selected changes. This may be enough to get a custom theme
            you like. Remember that many of the major settings can be inherited
            from areas that wrap inner areas.</li>
          <li>Finally, read this help document. There are lots of tips here, as
            well as fairly detailed explanations of exactly which CSS rules
            Weaver supports, and hints on how to go beyond the basics and really
            customize your site.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Previous Versions of Weaver</h4>
        <p>There have been three different versions of Weave: 2010 Weaver,
          Weaver, and Weaver II. While support for Weaver II will continue for
          some time, but ultimately <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> will completely
          replace that version.</p>
        <p><em>Weaver Xtreme</em> is a completely new theme. Much of its design
          is fundamentally different than Weaver II, and previous settings
          cannot be converted automatically. However, it is fairly easy to
          manually create new settings that correspond very closely to existing
          Weaver II sub-themes. Please see the <a href="#UpgradingWeaver">Upgrading
            from Weaver II</a> section for more detail.</p>
        <h4><a name="multisite" id="multisite"></a>Using With WordPress
          Multisite</h4>
        <p><em>Weaver Xtreme</em> will work with no additional settings on
          WordPress Multisite installations. However, there are some extra
          settings that help control which options are available to Multisite
          users.</p>
        <p>Note that all non-checkbox options for this theme are filtered based
          on the 'unfiltered_html' capability which is determined by the account
          role. This mostly means that non-Admins cannot add &lt;scripts&gt; or
          &lt;style&gt; directives anywhere. Regular Administrators are allowed
          to enter &lt;style&gt;, but not &lt;script&gt; directives. And, of
          course, Super-Administrators can enter anything.</p>
        <p>Note that non-Administrator accounts are not able to see <em>Weaver
            Xtreme</em> options on their Dashboard. However, the Per Page and
          Per Post options will be displayed by default to users with creation
          roles. You may want to restrict this on a per site basis. Either the
          Super-Administrator, or an individual sub-site Administrator can
          restrict access to the Per Page and Per Post option based on user role
          from the <span class="code1">Advanced Options : Admin Options</span>
          tab. </p>
        <h3><a name="homepage" id="homepage"></a>All About Your Site's Home Page</h3>
        <p>Your Home Page is the one that is displayed when a visitor enters the
          address of your WordPress Site. Commonly, your blog will serve as the
          home page, and WordPress will automatically add a Home item as the
          first item on your menu bar. (That is the default WordPress setting.)
          If you instead want a static page as your home, you can go to the
          dashboard <span class="code1">Settingsâ†’Reading</span> menu, and click
          the '<em>A static page</em>' option, and specify an existing static
          page to serve as Home. (It will be called Home on the menu even if it
          has a different name when you created it.) If you don't want a blog at
          all, you can leave the '<em>Posts page</em>' option as <em>'--Select--</em>',
          and no blog will be displayed. If you specify the name of an existing
          static page, then the default blog will be displayed using the title
          of that page. The content of that page (as well as the page's
          template, such as Page with Post) is ignored: that static page serves
          <em>only</em> to set the title for the blog page.</p>
        <p>Weaver gives you options on just what appears as your home page. The
          <span class="code1">Main Optionsâ†’Menu</span> Options section has an
          option called '<em>No Home Menu Item</em>'. If you check that, the
          automatically generated Home menu item goes away. That means if you
          have your blog set as the home page, there won't be a Home menu item
          to get back to it, but entering just your site name will get you to
          the blog.</p>
        <p>All that can be very confusing, to say the least. Here's how to get
          exactly what you want as your Home page.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Create a static page that you want to serve as your Home page - If
            you want it called Home, then give the page Home as its title. Add
            content as needed. If you want this page to be your <em>Blog Posts</em>,
            then use the <em>Page with Posts </em>template when you create the
            page, and check the 'Hide Page Title' in the Per Page Options
            section. Don't add any additional content.</li>
          <li>Check the 'No Home Menu Item' option in the <span class="code1">Main
              Optionsâ†’Menus</span> Options section.</li>
          <li>On the <span class="code1">Settingsâ†’Reading</span> menu, check
            the '<em>A static page</em>' option, and specify the page you
            defined in step 1 as the Front page. Set the Posts page top to '<em>--
              Select --</em>' if the static front page you specified will be
            your blog page or you don't want any blog page at all. If the blog
            will be on a non-home page, then enter the name of a blank place
            holder for the blog, as usual.</li>
          <li>You can use a Page with Posts page as your blog page, either as
            the Home page, or as a secondary page. Step 1 explained how to make
            it your Home page. Use the method of Step 3, and set the Posts page
            option to <em>--Select--</em>. This step is important. If you
            specify the static "Page with Posts" page in the selection box, you
            will end up with get the default blog page, and not your "Page with
            Posts" and any options you may have set for that page. And the main
            reason to use a "Page with Posts" for your blog page is to add
            filters to control just which posts are displayed -- something you
            can't do if you use the default Home page.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3><a name="DesignHints" id="DesignHints"></a>Design Hints</h3>
        <p>This section has a few hints on designing your own theme.</p>
        <h4>Choosing Colors</h4>
        <p>Good themes use related colors. Many times (but not always), when you
          look at the <span class="code1">Main Options</span> tab, you'll
          notice that all the colors should "look good". They don't have to, but
          having a nicely matching set of colors.</p>
        <p>The color picker has an interesting feature. Once you pick a color
          from the left section, the right bar shows different brightness levels
          of that color. This is especially useful for making a color lighter or
          darker.</p>
        <p>Some themes use the same colors for all links, some vary. But using
          the same link hover color for all the different kind of links lends
          consistency to your theme. The same is true for the other colors - try
          for a consistent look in your theme.</p>
        <h4>Testing</h4>
        <p>There a a couple of tricks that can help make testing you theme
          easier. However, you might find it easier to open a new tab in your
          browser. Open the theme admin page on one tab, and the main site on
          the other. After you make a change (and save them), you can toggle to
          the second tab and refresh the page.</p>
        <p>Another important thing is to <strong>change just one thing at a
            time</strong>. This may seem to take longer, but you will really be
          able to see the effect of your change this way and be sure it does
          what you want.</p>
        <p><span class="red-highlight">Important:</span> Most modern browsers
          will cache web pages it loads. Sometimes, this can make testing your
          site very difficult because the changes you make won't show up because
          the browser has cached your page. If you find this happening, you
          should clear the cache. Some browsers (e.g., Firefox and Chrome) have
          plugins available that will let you disable the cache. If you are
          using <em>Weaver Xtreme Plus</em>, you should develop your site with
          the <em>Weaver Xtreme Plus</em>:Development Mode checked. This will
          cause the CSS to be generated inline, which help with most cache
          issues.</p>
        <h4>Saving Option Settings</h4>
        <p>After you make any changes to the values of the <span class="code1">Main</span>
          or <span class="code1">Advanced Options</span>, you must save your
          changes. If you navigate away from the design tabs without first
          saving your values, <strong>everything will be lost</strong>. This is
          typical behavior for most WordPress settings screens. </p>
        <h4>Saving Your Own Theme</h4>
        <p>Once you have a design you like, you can save your work. You can then
          fiddle and fine tune more without losing your previous work. The
          easiest way to save your work is to go to the <span class="code1">Save/Restore</span>
          tab, and use the <em>Save/Restore Current Settings using WordPress
            Database</em> option. This will save all your settings in the
          WordPress database. Any settings you make will be preserved until you
          save new ones. They will survive theme switches and upgrades. If you
          want to restore those saved themes, click the <em>Restore Settings</em>
          button.</p>
        <p><em>Weaver Xtreme</em> basic version also allows you to save and save
          your settings on a file downloaded to your computer. There are two
          types of settings files - one that just saves the theme related
          options (and leaves out site specific options), and another that saves
          everything. These files can be downloaded to your own computer, or use
          by others to share you site design. And you can save many versions of
          your work.</p>
        <p>If you are experimenting, it is a good idea to save copies of your
          work so you can get back to where you were.</p>
        <h3><a name="PredefinedThemes" id="PredefinedThemes"></a>Weaver Xtreme
          Predefined Subthemes</h3>
        <p><em>Weaver X</em> comes with many predefined subthemes displayed on
          the <span class="code1">Weaver Xtreme Subthemes</span> tab. You can
          use them as-is, or as a starting point for your own designs. When you
          select a new subtheme, <em><strong>all</strong></em> the options
          values from the <span class="code1">Weaver Main Options</span> are
          cleared and set to the new values of the subtheme. Most of the <span
            class="code1">Advanced
            Options</span> are not changed.</p>
        <p>To select a predefined theme, pick one from the "Select a theme"
          list, and click the "Set to Selected Subtheme" button. Now you can
          open the <span class="code1">Main Options</span> Tab to start
          customizing the theme in ways you like.</p>
        <h4>About Some of the Subthemes</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Plain</strong> - This is a minimal theme that represents a good starting point with minimal options set.</li>
          <li><strong>Blank</strong> - This subtheme has no options set, and displays everthing using default values and styling from the base theme stylesheet. If you want total control of what you are building, this is the subtheme to start with.</li>
          <li><strong>Full Width Dark and Light</strong> (and demos) - The two subthemes are designed as good starting points for full width site designs. The Dark version is styled to effectively use a dark background. This can be simply a black background, or a dark image as found in the Demo version. The Light version is good for a light background. Using a plain white background results in a very simple, modern looking full width web site. The light demo has a light background image.<br />
          Both of the full width subthemes default to no sidebars, but that is easily changed. There are a significan number of custom CSS+ rules associated with these subthemes, and will require a bit of understanding and careful tweaking to make them your own.</li>
          <li><strong>Transparent Light and Dark</strong> - these are designed with transparency designed for dark and light background colors or images.</li>
          <li><strong>Ajax</strong> - this is a &quot;new&quot; subthems designed especially for Weaver Xtreme.</li>
        </ul>
<h2><a name="MainOptions" id="MainOptions"></a>Weaver Main Options</h2>
        <p>The <span class="code1">Main Options</span> tab provides you with
          hundreds of"check box" options for customizing your theme. This might
          seem overwhelming at first, but the options have been grouped
          according to the part of the theme they affect. Not only that, but the
          main options of the major "areas" are nearly identical, so you really
          don't need to learn hundreds of options. Each option includes an
          explanation as to what it does, often with extra information about
          using the option. It will be worth your time to scroll over all the
          options just to get an idea of all the things you can customize. Many
          of the options have been added after multiple requests from users on
          the Weaver Forum, and may not be anything you care about. Remember,
          these are choices - it is unlikely that any one site design will use
          all the available options.</p>
        <p>The options have been organized according to the different parts and
          functioning of your site's pages. The top of the <span class="code1">Main
            Options</span> page has tabs that let you quickly jump to each
          section.</p>
        <p> Please note that you can provide values for the color boxes in a
          couple of ways. The easiest way is to click on a color, and a color
          selection palette will pop up. You can also provide values directly.
          This includes hex values as well as text values. The text values can
          include standard web colors such as <em>red</em>, <em>blue</em>,
          etc.; <em>transparent</em>; or even <em>rgba()</em> values. This
          gives you maximum flexibility for specifying colors.</p>
        <p>Weaver defines default colors for many items. If the color value is
          blank, then the default value will be used. The default will either be
          the same as surrounding page elements, or be defined in the default
          theme style sheet. </p>
        <h5><a name="CSSOpts" id="CSSOpts"></a>CSS Options</h5>
        <p>For more experienced users, it is easy to add extra CSS styling to
          any of the elements included in the <span class="code1">Main Options</span>
          tab that have a color setting. When you click on the <strong>+</strong>
          button next to the CSS tag, a new input area will open. You can enter
          CSS style rules, <em>enclosed in {}'s</em>. These rules will be
          associated with the specific area that the color specifies. There are
          essentially two kinds of color setting options - a background (BG)
          color, and a text color. The CSS you add to the pop-open CSS box will
          apply to the associated area. In practice, it doesn't matter if the
          option is a BG or a text color - the rules will apply to the same
          item.</p>
        <p>Please see the CSS Help document to get more details on using this
          feature.</p>
        <h3><a name="GenApp" id="GenApp"></a>Wrapping Areas</h3>
        <p>The <span class="code1">Wrapping Areas</span> tab contains options
          that affect the overall look of your site, including both content and
          widget areas. These combine to give your site it overall look,
          including things such as width, outer margins, and more. The entire
          site is built under the Wrapper, and Container areas. <em>Hint</em>:
          You might want to experiment setting the options to primary colors
          (e.g., red, green, blue) just to get an idea of how they fit into the
          big picture. </p>
        <h3><a name="layout" id="layout"></a>Sidebars &amp; Layout</h3>
        <p><em>Weaver Xtreme</em> supports these sidebar layout arrangements:</p>
        <div class="layoutbox">
          <div class="l_layout"> <span class="l_header">Header</span> <span class="l_content">Content</span>
            <div class="l_stdbar"> <span class="l_righttop">Pri</span> <span class="l_rightup">Sec</span>
            </div>
            <span class="l_footer">Footer</span> <small>Single Column - Right</small>
          </div>
          <div class="l_layout"> <span class="l_header">Header</span>
            <div class="l_stdbar"> <span class="l_righttop">Pri</span> <span class="l_rightup">Sec</span>
            </div>
            <span class="l_content">Content</span> <span class="l_footer">Footer</span>
            <small>Single Column - Left</small> </div>
          <div class="l_layout"> <span class="l_header">Header</span>
            <div class="l_stdbar">Pri</div>
            <span class="l_contentcenter">Content</span>
            <div class="l_stdbar"> <span class="l_righttop">Sec</span> </div>
            <span class="l_footer">Footer</span> <small>Split - Left &amp;
              Right</small> </div>
          <div class="l_layout"> <span class="l_header">Header</span> <span class="l_contentw">Content</span>
            <span class="l_footer">Footer</span> <small>No Sidebars</small></div>
        </div>
        <p>The sidebars support two widget areas (Primary and Secondary). There
          are other widget areas supported, and described in the next section.</p>
        <p><em>Weaver Xtreme</em> allows control over site page layout,
          including margins, sidebar layout, and sidebar sizes. There are two
          major sidebar areas - one on the left of the site, and one on the
          right. The Layout tab allows you to control which layout is used for
          most of your pages. You can also set the layout for any individual
          static page from the Per Page Weaver option box displayed on the
          static <span class="code1">Page Editor</span> admin panel. Thus, you
          can essentially have any of the 4 different sidebar arrangements
          appear on <em>any</em> of your desktop view pages.</p>
        <p>If you want a double column sidebar, you can specify multiple columns
          of widgets for any of the widget areas, including the Primary and
          Secondary widget areas. This is the "Columns" option found on the
          "Widget Area" option groups.</p>
        <p>There are two different responsive display options for each of the 3
          arrangements with sidebars. Normally, when the site is viewed on a
          narrow device, the sidebars will stack vertically above or below the
          main content area. In normal mode, both the primary and secondary
          areas will stack below the content. When you select the "stack top"
          layout, then the primary sidebar will stack above the content on
          narrow devices, while the secondary area stacks below. This allows the
          flexibility to have navigation in the primary sidebar area instead of
          the main menus.</p>
        <p> One typical site design is to use one sidebar arrangement for
          regular pages - the blog, static pages, and single post pages, while
          using an alternate sidebar arrangement for the Archive-like pages -
          archives, categories, etc.</p>
        <p>The basic version of <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> allows you to specify a
          sidebar arrangement for those two basic cases. You can also
          alternatively specify a different sidebar arrangement for your blog,
          static pages, and the single post page. These options will allow great
          flexibility in site look. You can also set the sidebar arrangement on
          a per page basis.</p>
        <p>In addition, the <em>Weaver Xtreme Plus</em> version allows you to
          specify sidebar layout for each of the specific archive-like pages.</p>
        <p>You can also specify the width of any of the individual sidebar
          widget areas. These are expressed as percentages. You can add more
          precision to the percentage if needed (e.g., 24.375%).</p>
        <h3><a name="WidgetAreas" id="WidgetAreas"></a>Widget Areas</h3>
        <p>As just noted, <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> separates the sidebar wrapper
          areas from the sidebar widget areas. The <span class="code1">Sidebars
            &amp; Layout</span> tab also controls the background, margins, and
          borders of both individual widgets, and the different widget areas,
          including the sidebar widget areas, the top and bottom widget areas.
          The Header and Footer widget areas are controlled by the <span class="code1">Header</span>
          and <span class="code1">Footer</span> tabs.</p>
        <p>As part of the over all responsive design of <em>Weaver Xtreme</em>,
          the spacing between widgets, widget areas, and the content area are
          now specified using a general size option, and intelligently added by
          the theme. The theme "knows" how to add margins on the different sides
          of widgets, widget areas, and the main content area. Normally, you
          will only have to specify the size of the margin or padding you want.
          However, the <em>'Padding on Sides</em>' options allow you to specify
          which sides have padding.</p>
        <p><span class="style7">"Disappearing sidebars" - </span> If you find
          the sidebars are not displaying in the right place (they will usually
          end up below the content area), it means there is <strong>some
            incorrect HTML code in your page or post content</strong>. This is
          the most likely reason for this, although incorrect HTML in a widget
          (usually a text widget) can cause the same symptoms. This behavior is
          not due to any issues with <em>Weaver Xtreme</em>, but is inherently
          a part of the way HTML code works. The cause will almost always be a
          missing &lt;/div&gt; tag (or an extra &lt;div&gt;). HTML uses
          &lt;div&gt;...&lt;/div&gt; blocks to determine different parts of a
          web page. If your content has a missing &lt;/div&gt; tag, then the bad
          HTML will confuse your browser, resulting in the incorrect display of
          the sidebar. So, remember this. If your layout gets "confused", or
          things don't look right, it is 99.9999% certain you have some bad HTML
          in your content. If you use Firefox, it will show unbalanced HTML tags
          in red if you view the page source. There area also HTML validation
          sites that can help you find the bad code.</p>
        <h4><a name="PPWidgets" id="PPWidgets"></a>Per Page Extra Widget Areas</h4>
        <p><em>Weaver Xtreme</em> allows you to have as many widget areas you
          need. These new widget areas can be displayed on a per page basis. For
          example, using the Per Page options when you edit a page, you could
          have a different Top Widget Area, as well as different Primary or
          Secondary sidebars for every single page of your site if you wanted.
          You tell <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> to create these areas by providing a
          list of Widget Area names in this option area found at the bottom of
          the <em>Sidebars &amp; Layout</em> tab. The names can include
          letters, underscores, dash, or numbers, but not any spaces or other
          special characters. You can name them as you will - <em>mytop,mytop2,myprimary
            </em>and so on. These names are then used in the Per Page option
          area on the Page Editor screen to specify replacement widget areas.
          You can also use these extra widget areas with the <em>Weaver Xtreme</em>
          widget area shortcode.</p>
        <p><strong style="color:red">Important Note:</strong> You can reuse
          extra widget areas on different pages, but they should not be used
          more than once on any given page. If you use one of these extra widget
          areas more than once on the same page (for example, in both the header
          and footer widget areas), the layout results can be unpredictable.</p>
        <h4><a name="CustomWidgetWidth" id="CustomWidgetWidth"></a>Custom Widget
          Widths</h4>
        <p>With <em>Weaver Xtreme Plus</em>, you can optionally specify
          individual widget widths for most widget areas. This includes
          specifying widths for specific device: desktop, small tablet, and
          phones. </p>
        <p>You can specify how much space each individual widget takes in a row
          of the widget area on a percentage basis. For example, say you have
          three widgets in the Primary Widget Area (sidebar area), and you want
          the first two on the a top row, each taking half the space, and the
          third on the second row on the desktop view. You would do this by
          entering the value<span class="code1"> 50,50;100</span>; into the <em>Desktop</em>
          custom value box.</p>
        <p>Enter a percent width for each widget, separated by a comma (a blank
          will work, too). You also must indicate the end of each row by using a
          semi-colon (;) after the value of the last widget in each row. If you
          leave out the semi-colon, you might get unexpected wrapping.</p>
        <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Each row should add to no more than 100%. </li>
          <li>You can add as many widgets of varying widths to a row as you
            want.</li>
          <li>There is no limit to the number of rows.</li>
          <li> Don't add % to values. </li>
          <li>If you want to hide a specific widget on a particular device (say
            on phones), use 0 for its width to hide that widget. </li>
          <li>These custom values for specific device sizes override the Columns
            setting above the custom value boxes.</li>
          <li> The custom values entered for the Top and Bottom Widget areas
            apply to all top and bottom widget areas: Sitewide, Page, Blog, etc.
          </li>
          <li>These width settings use the fact that <em>Weaver Xtreme</em>
            adds a numbered widget class to each widget in a widget area:
            .widget1, .widget2, etc. So, for example, the rules generated for
            the first example would look like:<br />
            <pre>@media screen and (min-width:768px){ /*#primary-widget-area sb*/<span
class="css">
        #primary-widget-area .widget {float:left;margin-left:0;margin-right:0}
        #primary-widget-area .widget-1{width:49.00000%;margin-right:1.00000%;}
        #primary-widget-area .widget-2{width:50.00000%;}
        #primary-widget-area .widget-3{width:100.00000%;}
}      </span></pre>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a name="HeaderOpt" id="HeaderOpt"></a>Header Options</h3>
        <p>The Header Area is at the top of your site, and really gives the
          world the first impression of your site. Thus, there are many options
          for tweaking the site Header.</p>
        <p>Weaver supports up to two menu bars. With no additional action, your
          menu will be built automatically using the pages you've defined (using
          the Page Attributes <em>parent</em> and <em>order</em> settings).
          Display of your posts (blog) in the menu is determined by how you've
          set the main <em>Settings-&gt;Reading</em> Front page displays
          options. To use a second menu, you'll need to use <em>Appearance-&gt;Menus</em>,
          and define the Secondary Navigation menu. If you define the Primary
          Navigation menu, it will be used instead of the automatic menu
          generation from the Page Attributes settings. Note that by using the <em>Page
            with Posts</em> template to create a blog page, combined with the <em>Reading</em>
          Front page displays setting, and the <em>No Home Menu Item</em>, you
          have complete control over menu content and blog display.</p>
        <p>You also have several options for controlling basic display of the
          Site Title and Tagline (set in the dashboard <em>Settings-&gt;General
          </em>panel). If these settings don't give exactly what you want, the
          very best way to get exactly what you want is to use a photo or image
          editor to add exactly the site logo or title you want - you can simply
          hide the default display of the site title and tagline in that case.</p>
        <p><em>Weaver Xtreme</em> supports the variable sized header images. You
          can also check "Hide Header Image" to hide it. The header image will
          always be displayed using the site's full width, even if the "real"
          size is the default 940px width by 188px high. You can control how
          good the header image looks by varying its size and the compression
          ratio. Even so, you still must be aware of the file size of your
          header image (indeed, ALL images on your site.) Typically, you will
          want your image to be less than 100K bytes.</p>
        <p>You can also control how much space is displayed after the header and
          before the content.</p>
        <p>For ultimate control of the Header, it is possible to completely
          replace it on a site wide or per page basis using the <em>Header HTML</em>
          area on the <span class="code1">Header</span> tab or using the
          equivalent per page options.</p>
        <h3><a name="HeaderWidgetArea" id="HeaderWidgetArea"></a>Header &amp;
          Footer Horizontal Widget Areas</h3>
        <p><em>Weaver Xtreme</em> allows you to build great looking header and
          footer areas for your site using the Header and Footer Widget Areas.
          These areas support multiple widgets displayed horizontally in the
          header and footer areas. The Header Widget Area can be optionally
          placed in 4 different locations in the Header area using the "Header
          Widget Area Position" option on the Header options tab. The Footer
          Widget Area is placed at the top of the Footer.</p>
        <p>The free <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> version supports even sized columns.
          <em>Weaver Xtreme Plus</em> supports columns of arbitrary width.</p>
        <p>Consider this very simple example (the uneven column sizes require <em>Weaver
            Xtreme Plus</em>, but the ideas are the same for the free version).
          It has a menu on the left, a message next, the site name, and finally
          a banner image.</p>
        <table width="600" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" align="center"
          style="background: #E3D5A7;">
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td width="77" valign="top" align="left"><strong style="color:#009;">Home<br />
                  Page 1<br />
                  Page 2</strong></td>
              <td width="130" valign="bottom" align="center"><em>Welcome<br />
                  to our<br />
                  site! <br />
                </em></td>
              <td width="163" align="center"><strong>Weaver Xtreme Theme</strong></td>
              <td width="230"><img width="230" height="46" src="images/antique-ivory-thumbnail.jpg" /></td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>You can use any widget in the Header Widget Area. It is likely the
          standard Text Widget will be very useful here. For example, you can
          insert a welcome message, as well as a banner image using the Text
          Widget. Because <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> adds support for shortcodes in
          the Text Widget, you can put almost any shortcode feature in your
          header. But you could also use a Menu widget, a slide show widget, an
          RSS feed widget - whatever you might want in your header. </p>
        <p><strong>Widget Layout</strong></p>
        <p>For ultimate control over the look of the Header (or Footer) widget
          area, you may need <em>Weaver Xtreme Plus</em>. There area advanced
          options that allow you to specify exact widths for each widget, and
          for different mobile devices. You can show all or a subset of the
          widgets available for the widget area.</p>
        <p>Â </p>
        <h3><a name="MenuBar" id="MenuBar"></a>Menu Bar and Info Bar</h3>
        <p><em>Weaver Xtreme</em> allows you to control many aspects of the main
          menu bars, as well as the Info Bar. The Info Bar will normally be
          displayed right under the Primary Menu in the header. Depending on the
          menu content, it can be easy to confuse the two, and think that the
          Info Bar is a "doubled" menu.</p>
        <p><strong>Menu Bar</strong></p>
        <p><em>Weaver Xtreme</em> allows you to control the menu bar colors, as
          well as the colors of the submenus and hover colors. You can specify
          bold or italic text. </p>
        <p><strong>Info Bar</strong></p>
        <p>The Info Bar is new to <em>Weaver Xtreme</em>. It provides two basic
          features - a "breadcrumb" menu that shows the path to the current
          page. On blog pages, there is an additional "Navigation Page" display
          that displays a numbered menu for quick access to a specific block of
          blog posts. (Note: if you are using Yoast WordPress SEO and enable its
          breadcrumb support, <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> will automatically use
          Yoast's version instead of the built-in breadcrumbs.)</p>
        <p>You can hide the info bar, as well as control if the info bar is
          displayed right after the menu bar (thus taking the full width of the
          page), or right above the content area (thus only going to the
          sidebar). </p>
        <h3><a name="Links" id="Links"></a>Links</h3>
        <p>Options for all links now appear with the area they are in. Many
          sites will use the same coloring and style for all links, but Weaver
          allows you to control the default links, Post Info Line links, and
          Widget links separately.</p>
        <p>A separate color for Visited links has fallen out of widespread use,
          and is usually left the same as the regular link color. There is no
          direct option in <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> to set the visited link
          color.</p>
        <p><strong>Post Entry Title Link</strong></p>
        <p>Note that in WordPress, the title of each post is actually a link
          that will open the full single page view of each post. It is customary
          to style the post title to use the same color as page titles, but use
          a different hover color (which usually matches the standard link hover
          color) to indicate the title is a link.</p>
        <h3><a name="ContentAreas" id="ContentAreas"></a>Content Areas</h3>
        <p>The <em>Content Areas </em>section covers options that affect both
          your static page content, and blog post pages. These options all work
          as explained. The <em>Page Title Text</em> option is slightly
          different in that it applies only to static pages, and not to blog
          post titles. Each blog post title is actually a link to the full view
          page of that post, and uses the <em>Post Entry Title Link</em> set
          the post title color. </p>
        <h4>Multiple Column Page Content</h4>
        <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Weaver Xtreme</span> has added an
          option to automatically break your page content into multiple columns.
          The option may be applied globally from the Main Options tab, or
          specified on a Per Page basis from the Per Page option box.</p>
        <p>This is done using the CSS column-count attribute coupled with
          predefined <span style="font-style: italic;">Weaver Xtreme</span>
          classes <span class="css">.col-1</span> through <span class="css">.col-4</span>.
          The appropriate <span class="css">.col-n</span> class will be added
          to the class of the &lt;article&gt; HTML that wraps the page content.
          You can define you own .col-n rules to compliment the predefined
          version to specify other column- attributes such as column-rule or
          column-gap. For ultimate control you may want to specify @media rules
          for mobile devices.</p>
        <h3><a name="LeavingComments" id="LeavingComments"></a>Leaving Comments</h3>
        <p>It seems that disabling Comments and Talkbacks for posts and static
          pages is one of the more common tasks that people want to do, but have
          trouble finding the right options to do it. I don't think the
          WordPress interface makes it very clear what is going on, because this
          topic may be the #1 most asked question on the Weaver forum. So,
          here's the scoop on controlling comments.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>This is really not a theme issue â€“ the control is entirely done
            using regular WordPress options.</li>
          <li>Comments are controlled in the Dashboard <em>Settings-&gt;Discussion</em>
            page. There are quite a few options available, but if you want to
            disable comments by default for posts and pages, select the
            appropriate options on that page. (Unchecking the first 3 boxes will
            do it.) Don't forget about trackbacks and pingbacks because they can
            generate "comments" as well.</li>
          <li>If you've turned off comments by default (and you will probably
            end up doing that because even with Akismet and a Captcha plugin,
            you're likely to end up with plenty of spam), then you can re-enable
            comments for specific pages and posts from the Page and Post editor
            screens. There is an option panel on the<em> Page/Post editor</em>
            pages called "<em>Discussion</em>" with check boxes for that option.
            <strong>If you don't see that panel</strong>, you need to display it
            by opening the<em> Screen Options</em> tab in the upper right corner
            of the Page/Post editor page, and then check the <em>Discussion</em>
            show option.</li>
          <li>Now, if you created any posts or pages <em><strong>before</strong></em>
            you disabled comments, you'll have to go to each individual page and
            post and disable comments explicitly. Setting from the <em>Settings-&gt;Discussion</em>
            screen doesn't retroactively change the option. You'll have to
            delete any old comments you've accumulated as well.</li>
          <li>After you've done all this, by default, you will not see any
            reference to comments in the Post bottom info line, or at the bottom
            of regular pages. There is a Weaver <em>Main Options</em> in the
            Post Specifics section to display a "Comments are closed"e message
            if you want .</li>
        </ol>
        <h3><a name="PPSpecifics" id="PPSpecifics"></a>Post Specifics</h3>
        <p>Next to the Header, it seems that control of just how Posts (blog
          articles) are displayed is something many people want. This section
          discusses some of the things you can control.</p>
        <p><strong>The Info Lines</strong></p>
        <p> Each post has two information lines (also called Meta Info). The
          line right after the title has the date of the post and the author.
          The last line of the post has the post's category, tags, and link for
          comments. You can control the appearance of these Meta lines in
          several ways. The two Info BG color settings let you put a background
          color behind the Meta lines if you wish, and you can add CSS to them
          for more effects. You can use the default Meta info wording with |
          separators, <em>or</em> use Icons for each part of the meta info. You
          can selectively hide different parts of the meta info (which forces
          use of icons, however). (Comments will always be displayed if they are
          enabled and associated with a post.) One of the design features of <em>Weaver
            Xtreme</em> is that it is dependent on the need to provide fixed
          translations for the user interface wording. Thus, it is not possible
          to change the wording such as Posted on date by author. If you don't
          like that wording, you can use icons instead. There are two choices of
          icon sets to use.</p>
        <p><strong>Full Posts and Excerpts</strong> </p>
        <p> Posts are displayed in three distinct places: the main blog page,
          when part of a specified list (archives, categories, author, etc.), or
          when displayed as a single page by itself. The full content of a post
          is always displayed on the single page view. The blog page displays
          the excerpt of a post, which then causes a "Continue reading..."
          message to be displayed on the blog page. In special list views
          (archives, etc.), posts are displayed as excerpts. These excerpts are
          normally 55 words long, with all images, formatting, and links
          removed. You can adjust the excerpt length. You can specify to display
          full posts on special post list pages, and display posts as full
          articles on the main blog page (which can be combined with the
          Featured Image to generate nice looking post list). These can also be
          controlled on a per post basis from the Edit Post page. Note that
          checking a display as full post option does <em>not</em> override
          your manual placement of &lt;!--more--&gt; tags.</p>
        <h4><a name="FeaturedImage" id="FeaturedImage"></a>The Featured Image</h4>
        <p>You may have seen the Set <em>Featured Image</em> option on your
          post and static page edit panel. What is it good for? Unfortunately,
          there is no specific WordPress standard on how to use Featured Images.
          However, the most common practice is to display the Featured Image at
          the front of a page or post. <em>Weaver Xtreme</em>'s design has
          attempted to maximize their usefulness. </p>
        <p>There are four sets of options for how to use the Featured Image
          (FI): for Pages, for full and excerpted Posts, and for the single page
          post view. You can control when and where the FI is displayed for each
          of those cases, you can set the exact size (in a responsive % size!),
          and if the FI is hidden on different devices. You can even specify
          that the FI serve as an alternate header image for Pages and Single
          Post view.</p>
        <p>No other theme offers you the choices for using the FI. Take time to
          explore all the options.</p>
        <p><strong>Other Options</strong></p>
        <p>You can set the background color for sticky posts. (Add
          {border:none;padding:0;} to the CSS of the <em>Sticky Post BG</em>
          option to make sticky posts look like other posts.)</p>
        <p>You can control author information display, as well. You can also
          show the author's avatar (as defined by a gravatar.com account, for
          example) on each post. By default, if the author has included
          biographical information on author's account settings page, that
          information will be included when the post's single page view is
          displayed. You can hide that.</p>
        <p>When a visitor clicks on a image thumbnail, an attachment page will
          open up with the full sized view of the image. If you want your
          visitors to be able to leave comments for that image, check the <em>Allow
            comments for attachments</em> box.</p>
        <h4><a name="PhotoBlog" id="PhotoBlog"></a>Photo Blogging</h4>
        <p><em>Weaver Xtreme</em> has a couple of features that make creating a
          Photo Blog easy. The three main features to help with creating a photo
          blog include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Multi-column blog layout. <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> free version
            allows you to display your blog entries in up to 3 columns. <em>Weaver
              Xtreme Plus</em> makes this even better by including support for
            the Masonry dynamic layout feature which will squeeze your posts as
            close together as possible in up to 5 columns.<br />
            <br />
            You can specify the column layouts either globally from the <em>Main
              Options -&gt; Post Specifics</em> tab, or on a <em>Per Page</em>
            basis if you are using the <em>Page with Posts</em> template using
            the Per Page option box on the page editor.<br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>The <em>Compact "Post Format" Posts</em> option will make each
            post formatted using one of several "Post Formats" display in a
            compact form. For Photo Blogging, this option is especially useful
            for the <em>Image Post Format</em>. By default, the <em>Image Post
              Format</em> will show the first image from your post with a
            different post info line. But compact display option makes the
            "Image Post Format" display only the first image found in a post
            with no borders, no margins, no excerpt, and no extra text of any
            kind - just a plain image. That image links to the post's single
            page view. If there is no image, then the text content of the post
            will be displayed. This allows you to include short descriptive text
            between your images if you need. Other post formats have similar
            compact versions.<br />

          <li><em>Page with Posts</em> - this <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> page
            template allows you to show your posts as a blog anywhere you like,
            and include filtering and other per page options that you can fine
            tune to make a great looking Photo Blog.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Hints</strong></p>
        <p>Here are some hints for creating a Photo Blog:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>First, bulk load all your photos into the media library. You might
            want to update the photo title, alt, caption, and description fields
            when you upload, although you can do that later.</li>
          <li>For each photo you want in your blog, create a separate post. Give
            the post a description of each photo. It is probably best to have a
            separate post per photo. When you add the image to the post,
            remember to select you want the image linked - either to the raw
            image that displays the image only in your browser, or as an
            attachment that will display the image full size on a standard site
            page.</li>
          <li>Be <strong>sure</strong> to check the "Image" radio button for
            the post found in the <em>Format</em> box at the right side of the
            Post Editor page. (If the <em>Format</em> box isn't showing, open
            the "Screen Options" in the upper right and check the appropriate
            box.)</li>
          <li>You will also likely find it useful to assign a <em>Category</em>
            to each post. You can use categories to organize different "albums",
            and then use a <em>Page with Posts</em> template's filters to
            display each album on a separate page. You can also use the
            categories to filter out images from your regular blog.</li>
          <li>Enable the <em>Compact "Post Format" Posts</em> option. This will
            show your images in a good looking, image only format on your blog
            pages. You can set this globally from the <em>Main Options -&gt;
              Post Specifics</em> tab, or you can set it on a Per Page basis
            from the per page options box on a <em>Page with Posts</em> page.</li>
          <li>Each post can contain as much information as you like. As you add
            each image, you have the opportunity to fill in a caption, title,
            and alt tag. You can also add whatever commentary you like to the
            image. You can have as many images as you want on a post, but only
            the first one is displayed on the blog view.</li>
          <li>If you'd like some text mixed in with all your images on the blog
            view, you can easily accomplish that by creating a text-only Image
            Format post. You can use these comments to separate subjects, years,
            or anything else you might want.</li>
          <li>Display your Image posts using multi-column layout. If you have <em>Weaver
              Xtreme</em> Free Version, you can display your images in up to
            three columns. You can set the globally for all blog pages, or use
            the Per Page setting for a <em>Page with Posts</em>. You photos
            will be displayed as an image only organized in columns, laid out
            row by row, left to right. Whenever a visitor clicks an image, it
            will option the post's single page view.</li>
          <li>If you want even cooler photo layouts, upgrade to <em>Weaver
              Xtreme Plus</em>, and you will have access to the <em>Masonry</em>
            blog post layout feature. When enabled, <em>Masonry</em> will pack
            all your posts on a blog page in up to five columns, and remove all
            vertical space between posts with uneven height - no need for plain
            row by row layout. <em>Masonry</em> will work with standard blog
            posts, but works especially well with the compact image posts.</li>
          <li>When you use <em>Masonry</em>, you also have the option to
            specify on a Per Post basis that a post should span two columns
            (available on the Per Post options box on the post editor). This is
            especially useful to have your horizontally oriented images cover
            two columns. You can even specify this for regular posts for ones
            you might want to cover two columns.</li>
          <li>Typically, a blog page will display only a few posts (10 is
            typical) before adding paging. The number of posts to display on a
            blog page is a global setting found on the<em> Settings -&gt;
              Reading</em> tab. If you are displaying many photos in a compact
            format, you will want to show many more than just 10. There is an
            option included on the Page with Posts per page filter section that
            will allow you to set how many posts to show on one page.</li>
          <li>Remember, using <em>Weaver Xtreme</em>'s <em>Page with Posts</em>
            template, you can create multiple blog pages on your site - standard
            text posts, photo posts, and any other kind of set of posts you can
            imagine - all by setting the appropriate filters on the Per Post
            option page.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><a name="CustomInfo" id="CustomInfo"></a>Custom Post Info Lines</h4>
        <p>One commonly request is the ability to tweak the top and bottom info
          lines associated with blog posts. <em>Weaver Xtreme Plus</em> now
          includes a template function that gives you total control over the top
          and bottom info lines of posts displayed on a blog page, and posts
          displayed on the single page.</p>
        <p>The custom info lines are set on the <span class="code1">Main
            Options:Post Specifics:Custom Info Lines</span> tab. You can change
          the top and bottom info lines on blog pages (including Page with Posts
          and [show_posts], and on the single page. You need to specify all
          options if you want the standard info lines replaced.</p>
        <p>The text you specify can contain any valid HTML you wish, plus a set
          of special template %values% that will get replaced by the correct
          values for the specific post. For example, setting the Top Post Info
          line to:</p>
        <p class="code1">&lt;strong&gt;%title%:&lt;/strong&gt; %date-icon%%date%
          %author-icon%%author%</p>
        <p>will create a top info line that looks like this:</p>
        <p><img width="406" height="23" src="images/custom-info-line.png" /></p>
        <p>The <em>%title%</em> is replaced by the post's title. The <em>%date-icon%</em>
          produces the calendar icon, while <em>%date% </em>produces the
          published date and link to the post. Similarly, the<em> %author-icon%</em>
          and <em>%author%</em> produce the author and link to the author
          archive page. Given a mixture of HTML, possibly including styling, and
          the provided set of parameters, you can build almost any combination
          of relevant information on the post top and bottom information lines.
        </p>
        <p>There is no restriction on which values can be used on which line,
          nor other HTML you might wish to include. You can include whatever
          text you want mixed in with the definition. Some of the values allow
          you to override the standard text included with the standard values
          (e.g., 'permalink'). If you define an info line template, it will
          override any other info line setting you have (except hiding and
          position swap).</p>
        <p>Here is a list of the supported template values:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>%date%</strong> - Replaced with the date link of post
            (links to post single page)</li>
          <li><strong>%date-icon%</strong> - Replaced with the standard date
            icon (a calendar). If used, should be used in conjunction with the
            %date% value (and similarly for other -icon values).</li>
          <li><strong>%day%</strong> - Replaced with day (1-31)</li>
          <li><strong>%day0%</strong> - Replaced with day (01-31)</li>
          <li><strong>%weekday%</strong> - Replaced with name of week day (e.g.,
            for English, Monday)</li>
          <li><strong>%month%</strong> - Replaced with full name of month (e.g.,
            January)</li>
          <li><strong>%month-num%</strong> - Replaced with month number (1-12)</li>
          <li><strong>%month0%</strong> - Replaced with month number (01-12)</li>
          <li><strong>%month3%</strong> - Replaced with month abbreviation (Jan)</li>
          <li><strong>%year%</strong> - Replaced with 4 digit year</li>
          <li><strong>%author%</strong> - Replaced with the author's name and
            link to author archive page</li>
          <li><strong>%author-name%</strong> - Replaced with the author's name,
            no link</li>
          <li><strong>%author-icon%</strong> - Replaced with the standard author
            icon (a head and shoulders)</li>
          <li><strong>%author-email%</strong> - Replaced with "mailto:" link to
            author. </li>
          <li><strong>%avatar%</strong> - Replaced with a small version of the
            author's avatar (gravatar, etc.)</li>
          <li><strong>%category%</strong> - Replaced with a list of categories
            of the post (with links)</li>
          <li><strong>%category-icon%</strong> - Replaced with the category icon
            (folder)</li>
          <li><strong>%tag%</strong> - If the post has tags, replaced with a
            list of the post's tags (with links)</li>
          <li> <strong>%tag-icon%</strong> - If the post has tags, replaced
            with tags icon (tag)</li>
          <li> <strong>%tag:Label if are tags%</strong> - If you want a text
            label for tags, this will display the text that comes after the
            "tag:" if the post has tags. A post always has categories, so this
            form is not needed for categories - just add the text into the
            definition if you need a label for categories.</li>
          <li><strong>%title%</strong> - replaced with the post title - not
            linked</li>
          <li><strong>%post-format%</strong>- replaced with the post format of
            the post if it is defined (no link)</li>
          <li><strong>%comments%</strong> - Replaced with the standard link to
            the comment box on the single page. Not displayed if comments are
            disabled. Will have a different message for 0, 1, and &gt;1
            comments. You can change the messages displayed by %comments&amp;
            using the 'comments0-2' values below.</li>
          <li><strong>%comments-icon%</strong> - Replaced with the comment icon
            (a bubble)</li>
          <li><strong>%comments:Label if comments open%</strong> - If you want a
            non-linked text label for comments, this will display the text that
            comes after the "comments:" if the comments are open for a post.</li>
          <li><strong>%comments0:Text if no comments%</strong> - Replaced with
            empty string, but sets the message used when no comments have been
            submitted for this post. Use a '#' in your string to display actual
            number of comments. (Note: you must still use the %comments% option
            to have the comments link displayed.)</li>
          <li><strong>%comments1:Text if one comment%</strong> - Used when
            exactly 1 post. Use a '#' in your string to display actual number of
            comments (0).</li>
          <li><strong>%comments2:Text if more than 1 comment%</strong> - Used
            when more than 1 post. Use a '#' in your string to display actual
            number of comments (1).</li>
          <li><strong>%the_permalink%</strong> - Replaced with the raw permalink
            address to the post appropriate to use as an href= value.</li>
          <li><strong>%permalink%</strong> - Replaced with the permalink to the
            post - includes standard text (permalink), which can be replaced
            with value below.</li>
          <li><strong>%permalink-icon%</strong> - Replaced with permalink icon
            (chain) plus the permalink string (this is different than the other
            icon values, but this value needs to work this way.) Unlike other
            -link values, you will never use both $permalink% and
            %permalink-icon%.</li>
          <li><strong>%permalink:Permalink-text%</strong> - Used to set the text
            used for the permalink link.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Â </p>
        <h3><a name="FooterOpt" id="FooterOpt"></a>Footer Options</h3>
        <p>The <span class="code1">Footer</span> options tab controls basic
          Footer appearance, including the standard area options. The options
          for the Footer Widget area are also on the <span class="code1">Footer</span>
          tab.</p>
        <p> <label><b>Site Copyright</b></label> <br />
          If you fill this in, the default copyright notice in the footer will
          be replaced with the text here. It will not automatically update from
          year to year. Use <span class="style4">&amp;copy;</span> to display
          Â©. You can use other HTML as well. Use <span class="style4">&amp;nbsp;</span>
          to hide the copyright notice. <label></label> </p>
        <h3><a name="Fonts" id="Fonts"></a>Fonts</h3>
        <p>With the <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> basic version, each area has the
          ability to set font color, size, family, bold, and italic. All font
          sizes are set using general size option, and use the 'em' unit.</p>
        <p>In addition, the design is based on a single "Site Base Font Size".
          This value is expressed in px, and defaults to 16px. This means the
          default medium font size is 16px. All other text elements are sized in
          'ems' using that base size. This means that 1em equals 16px. Changing
          the base font size affects all other font sizes such as headings,
          titles, etc.</p>
        <p>Note that it still possible to set the size and font family using
          Custom CSS Rules with the <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> basic version.
          However, <em>Weaver Xtreme Plus</em> provides much greater control
          over fonts.</p>
        <p>The Custom A and B font size options on the Main Options Custom &amp;
          Fonts tab allow you to define a new font size to use anywhere the Font
          Size option shows. So you might want a really big font and put 6 in
          the font size box.</p>
        <p><strong><a href="font-demo.html" target="_blank">See Basic Web Fonts
              and Google Fonts supported by Weaver Xtreme</a></strong></p>
        <h4>Weaver Xtreme Plus Font Control</h4>
        <p>The <em>Weaver Xtreme Plus Font Control</em> will allow you add
          Google Fonts and other free and commercial fonts. The added Google
          Fonts will be automatically added to the Font Family selection options
          after they've been defined. </p>
        <h2><a name="Custom" id="Custom"></a>Custom Options</h2>
        <p>The <em>Custom</em> tab allows you to set some custom options. These
          options tend to be more advanced, and many are supported only by <em>Weaver
            X</em>. </p>
        <h4>Site Base Font Size</h4>
        <p>One of the most important custom options is the <em>Site Base Font
            Size</em>. The default for this is 16px, and determines the default
          font size used by your site. When used with most browser default font
          size, visitors will see fonts 16 px. The end user can change what the
          default font is on the browser, so this value does not guarantee that
          is the size the user will see. </p>
        <p> In all other places on the site, the font sizes are mostly
          determined by the relatively new HTML 'rem' unit. Some sizes use em or
          % for better responsive display. If you are unfamiliar with 'rem', you
          can read more about it on the web, but many web designers believe that
          using 'rem' font sizes is best design practice, and <em>Weaver Xtreme</em>
          has adopted that practice. </p>
        <h4>Smart Margin Width</h4>
        <p>Another important custom option is the <em>Smart Margin Width</em>.
          This is a <em>Weaver Xtreme Plus</em> only feature. This value is
          used to determine the automatic horizontal margins (spacing or
          gutters, really) generated by <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> between some
          horizontal areas (like between the content and the sidebars). The
          default value of 1% leads to very good looking sites, with an
          appealing amount of spacing. If you need looser or tighter horizontal
          spacing, you can change this value. </p>
        <h4>Custom Font Size and Families</h4>
        <p><em>Weaver Xtreme Plus</em> allows you to specify two custom font
          sizes and families. These choices are available directly from the font
          size and font family options found with most text areas. </p>
        <p>The custom font family is most useful when used with a custom font.
          This is typically done by adding a &lt;link&gt; or other HTML code to
          the &lt;head&gt; section to load a font from your own or an external
          site. You would then specify the name of the font family provided by
          that font in one of the custom font family boxes. </p>
        <h4><a name="CustomCSS" id="CustomCSS"></a>The Custom CSS Rules Section</h4>
        <p>This section may be one of the most useful and used advanced option
          sections. This option is found on the<span class="code1"> Main Options
            : Custom</span> tab. This is where you can enter custom CSS to fine
          tune the styling of your site. The sources for these CSS rules can
          vary. </p>
        <p>You should enter just CSS rules in this box. Don't include a
          &lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt; block. The style rules you add here will
          be included after any other CSS rules <em>Weaver Xtreme</em>
          generates - so they will override those rules.</p>
        <p>Note that with <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> Basic, these CSS rules will be
          added to the general &lt;style&gt; section <em>Weaver Xtreme</em>
          generates in the site &lt;head&gt; block. In <em>Weaver Xtreme Plus</em>,
          this code is added at the end of the actual .css style file <em>Weaver
            Xtreme Plus</em> generates, and won't appear directly in the
          &lt;head&gt; block.</p>
        <p>The <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> documentation also includes a short
          introduction of CSS, and you will likely find it worth your time to
          learn a a bit about CSS.</p>
        <p>Note: You can also insert code into the &lt;HEAD&gt; section on a per
          page basis when you use the Edit Page editor. If you define a <em>Custom
            Field</em> named <em>page-head-code</em> for the page, then you can
          supply HTML for that page's &lt;HEAD&gt; section.</p>
        <p>The <strong>CSS+</strong> boxes associated with every color and
          background color selection box in the <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> Options
          can also be used to enter Custom CSS Rules. If you add CSS to a CSS+
          box, you need not enter any id or class name - the proper ids or
          classes will be automatically provided to match the item associated
          with the color selection box.</p>
        <p><strong>Directory Macro Replacement for CSS images</strong></p>
        <p>Sometimes you might want to add a background image to a style (e.g.,
          using a url() value). Those images need to be stored someplace
          available to visitors to your site. One typical place is to use the
          WordPress media gallery, and use the full URL to those images.</p>
        <p>Because you might be building a child theme, or an Add-on Subtheme, <em>Weaver
            Xtreme Plus</em> provides a handy macro replacement capability for
          Custom CSS Rules and CSS+ rules. For example, if you want to supply
          some background images for a child theme, and you would like to save
          those images in a directory called /images in the child theme
          directory, you can use the macro %stylesheet_directory% in a style
          url() value.</p>
        <p>For example, say you've built a child weaver theme, and have a file
          called content-bg.jpg stored in the child theme's /images directory.
          You can specify the location of that file in a site independent manner
          by using:</p>
        <p>#content {background-image:
          url(%stylesheet_directory%images/content-bg.jpg);}</p>
        <p>The %stylesheet_directory% will be replaced in the generated CSS code
          as</p>
        <p>url(/wp-content/themes/your-child-theme/images/content-bg.jpg)</p>
        <p>The file directory macros supported by <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> will
          produce a root-relative path, and include the trailing /. Using a
          root-relative path eliminates issues with http and https protocols,
          and will be site independent. The following macro values are
          supported:</p>
        <p>%template_directory% - the main theme directory. If the theme is a
          child theme, this will be the directory of the parent theme (so
          /weaver-xreme/).</p>
        <p>%stylesheet_directory% - the directory of the theme's stylesheet -
          thus if it is a child theme, then this will be the child theme's
          directory.</p>
        <p>%dendrologicals% - the directory where <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> loads
          Add-on Subthemes. Add-on Subthemes are available for download from
          WeaverTheme.com, and are loaded in the /uploads/weaver x-subthemes/add
          on-subthemes/ directory. This value is useful for providing images
          with Add-on Subthemes.</p>
        <h2><a name="CSSPlus" id="CSSPlus"></a>CSS+</h2>
        <p>You probably have noticed the <strong>CSS+</strong> button next to
          many of the color options. This option allows you to add your own
          custom CSS for most elements of your site. Using this option does
          require a bit of CSS knowledge.</p>
        <p>We will give an example of using this option. For example, say you've
          set the<em> Header Area BG</em> option to <span class="css">#59AD44</span>,
          but you'd like a custom border around it. CSS+ makes this easy. When
          you click the CSS+ button, a dialog box is opened where you can enter
          a CSS rule. The rule should include the <span class="css">{}</span>'s
          plus the css rules. So, to add a wide red border around the header
          area, you would put <span class="css">{border: 4px solid red;}</span>
          in the box. The theme will then add the appropriate selector for the
          header (#header in this case) to your rule and add that to the
          generated CSS. For this example, this will result in the following
          rules being generated:</p>
        <pre>#header {background-color:<span class="css">#59AD44</span>;}
#header {border: 4px solid red;}</pre>
        <p>In this case, the selector, #header, is pretty simple. For other
          options, the required selector can be much more complex, but you don't
          have to know the details. In some cases, there is even more than one
          selector</p>
        <p>You can add more than one rule to the CSS+ box, but the selector is
          applied only to the first rule. For example, if your CSS+ rules were:
          <span class="css">{font-style:italic;}
            .custom-font{font-family:serif;}</span> the output would be (using
          #header again) <span class="css">#header {font-style:italic;}
            .custom-font{font-family:serif;}</span>.</p>
        <p>If you would like the option's selector to be applied to additional
          rules, CSS+ supports a "macro" called <span class="css">%selector%</span>.
          Wherever you use <span class="css">%selector%</span> in your CSS+, it
          will be replaced by the selector associated with the option. Using the
          last example, <span class="css">{font-style:italic;} %selector%
            .custom-font{font-family:serif;}</span> would generate: <span class="css">#header
            {font-style:italic;} #header .custom-font{font-family:serif;}</span>.
          Spacing is significant - if you don't have a space right after the <span
            class="css">%selector%</span>,
          there won't be one in the output. If there are multiple associated
          selectors for the option, there will be a rule generated for each
          selector. You can use <span class="css">%selector%</span> as many
          times as you need. If you put it on the first rule, however, you'll
          get a doubled selector (<span class="css">#header #header</span>).</p>
        <p>Some <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> users like to organize their custom CSS
          rules by adding them to a related color option instead of putting them
          in the main Custom CSS option. That is entirely acceptable. If you
          don't want to add any extra styling for the actual option, you can
          simply include a blank rule at the beginning: <span class="css">{}
            .custom{rule}</span>.</p>
        <p>And finally, you might have noticed there is not a CSS+ rule on all
          the colors. More specifically, you'll see that most options include a
          BG color with a CSS+ and a text color without it. In cases like this,
          it means that the selector for the BG and text color are identical, so
          just use the BG color CSS+.</p>
        <h3><a name="genericons" id="genericons"></a>Genericons - Add Icons to
          Your Content</h3>
        <p><em>Weaver Xtreme</em> uses an icon font set called "Genericons" for
          the Menus, Post Format Icons, the post meta info icons, and by<em>
            Weaver Xtreme Plus</em> for social icons. This font set is <em>always</em>
          loaded, and thus is available for your use as well. You can easily
          insert any one of these fonts into your content.<br />
        </p>
        <div style="text-align:center;"><img width="482" height="381" src="images/genericons.png"
            alt="Genericons" /></div>
        <p><br />
          To insert one of any of these icons into your content, follow these
          steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Enter "Text" mode in the WordPress page/post editor.</li>
          <li>Visit the <a href="http://genericons.com" title="Genericons Site"
              target="_blank">Genericons
              Site</a>.</li>
          <li>Click on the icon you want to use. This will display information
            about the icon at the top of the page.</li>
          <li>Click the "Copy HTML" link, and copy the HTML code that is
            displayed.</li>
          <li>Paste that code into your content wherever you want it to be
            displayed.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2><a name="MobileHelp" id="MobileHelp"></a>Mobile</h2>
        <p>Having a great looking mobile view of your website has become an
          essential part of any modern website. <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> has you
          covered! <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> works seamlessly on all mobile
          devices, automatically adjusting the styling for three screen sizes:
          desktops, small tablets, and phones. Large tablets like the iPad are
          treated the same as a standard desktop.</p>
        <p>The <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> Mobile menu is one of the best available.
          Instead of creating a potentially huge single list of menu choices as
          found on most other WordPress themes, the <em>Weaver Xtreme</em>
          mobile menu is a true collapsing menu, and is among the easiest menus
          for mobile users to use.</p>
        <h3>An Overview of Mobile Friendly Website Design</h3>
        <h4><strong>Responsive Design</strong></h4>
        <p>This section will explain some of the technical details of how mobile
          devices are supported. You may have heard the term "Responsive Themes"
          to describe themes that support mobile devices. Responsive design
          allows the content of any website to automatically adjust to the size
          of the display screen. You can easily determine if a website is
          responsive from a desktop browser by using the mouse to make the
          display window narrower and narrower. If the site is responsive, the
          images will shrink automatically to fit in the window. As the window
          gets smaller and smaller, some content (such as sidebars) will
          rearrange itself, or disappear altogether.</p>
        <p>All this magic is done entirely by using appropriate CSS styling, and
          special CSS rules called "@media" rules which allow the site to use
          different CSS rules depending on the width of the site. The other
          major component of responsive design is using relative sized for
          content such as font sizes or images. As a rule, using fixed pixel
          sizes (px) for elements will render the site non-responsive. While it
          can still be appropriate to use fixed px sizes for some items with
          small widths, in general all sizes are replaced by percentages (%).
          Then as the screen size shrinks, content will adjust automatically.</p>
        <p>One of the big advantages of a totally responsive design is that it
          depends solely on the width of the display screen. It is not necessary
          to know if the site is being displayed on a specific device or device
          type. <em>Weaver Xtreme</em>'s design is totally Responsive at its
          heart.</p>
        <h4>Advantages of Pure Responsive Design</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Works with all WordPress cache plugins.</li>
          <li>Will display nicely on any mobile device, as well as respond as
            user shrinks desktop browser.</li>
          <li>In general, you will pay less attention to mobile vs. desktop
            contentÂ visibility. Â Responsive mode has some ability to selectively
            display content depending on device, but it is all based on the
            display width of the mobile browser. Anything you "hide" for a
            mobile browser will also be hidden on a narrow desktop browser
            window.Â </li>
          <li>View what your site will look like on mobile devices simply by
            shrinking your browser window.</li>
          <li>Most modern mobile browsers will not actually download content
            that is hidden for their specific screen width, so responsive
            display is very efficient.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Mobile Device Pure Responsive Custom CSS</strong></p>
        <p>When designing for responsive display, you must always use relative
          sizes: percent, ems, and so on. <strong>Never</strong> use px for
          anything other than a few pixels of fine tuning placement.</p>
        <p>The Custom CSS option box will normally come filled in with the
          appropriate @media blocks for the three different size devices.</p>
        <h2><a name="AdvancedOptions" id="AdvancedOptions"></a>Weaver Advanced
          Options</h2>
        <p>The <span class="code1">Advanced Options</span> page allows you to
          define many more advanced options. While the Basic version of <em>Weaver
            Xtreme</em> supports many Advanced Options, some are available only
          in the <em>Weaver Xtreme Plus</em> version.</p>
        <p>The values you put here are saved in the WordPress database, and will
          survive theme upgrades and other changes. </p>
        <p>PLEASE NOTE: Limited validation is made on the field values, so be
          careful not to paste invalid code. Invalid code is usually harmless,
          but it can make your site display incorrectly. If your site looks
          broken after you add settings in these sections, please double check
          that what you entered uses valid HTML commands.</p>
        <h3> <a name="HeadSection" id="HeadSection"></a>Site &lt;HEAD&gt;
          Section </h3>
        <p>The &lt;HEAD&gt; Section tab includes two major setting areas. These
          areas are used to provide advanced code to enhance the functionality
          and style of your site.</p>
        <h4>The &lt;HEAD&gt; Section</h4>
        <p>This input area is one of the most important options in Weaver for
          customizing your site. Code entered into this tab is included right
          before the &lt;/head&gt; tag in your site. This code can include
          almost anything that can be added to the &lt;head&gt; section of a
          site. One of the most common uses will be to add code snippets
          provided by outside sites such as Google Analytics. You can also
          provide extra links to external style sheets or JavaScript libraries
          as might be needed. Note: adding JavaScript to the &lt;HEAD&gt;
          section requires that you have the Weave X Theme Support plugin
          installed. </p>
        <h4>Â </h4>
        <h3><a name="ActionsFilters" id="ActionsFilters"></a>Actions and Filters</h3>
        <p>This block lets you add arbitrary PHP code to your site. This main
          purpose of this feature is to allow you to add WordPress Actions and
          Filters for plugins and many standard WordPress actions and filters.
          This is a very advanced option, and some understanding of PHP code and
          how WordPress actions and filters work is expected.</p>
        <p>Technically, any PHP code you add here will be executed at the very
          beginning of the theme's header.php template file. This file does not
          get loaded and executed until the core WordPress engine has loaded the
          main theme files (e.g., functions.php), so it will be too late to add
          actions or filters for many WordPress options. But any actions or
          filters used to generate content of a page can be added at this point
          of execution. However, the code can <em>not</em> be used to override
          pluggable functions in the theme's functions.php file.</p>
        <p>You can add arbitrary PHP code here, but normally this code will just
          be add_action and add_filter calls, plus supporting function
          definitions. You can probably add enqueue_style and enqueue_script
          functions as well, as those functions are typically used later in the
          header.php file.</p>
        <p>The code you define is executed using the PHP eval() function.<em>
            Any PHP errors will cause failure of the site to load properly.</em>
          Specifically, you should <strong>NOT</strong> wrap the code with
          &lt;?php at the beginning and ?&gt; at the end. You can use them
          within the code as needed.</p>
        <h3><a name="HTMLInsertion" id="HTMLInsertion"></a>HTML Code Insertion
          Areas </h3>
        <p>The options in this section allow you to insert HTML code into
          various regions of your pages. In addition to the HTML Insertion boxes
          on the <em>Advanced Options : HTML Insertion</em> tab, there are also
          specialized HTML Code Insertion area for the Header and Footer found
          on those admin tabs. These areas must use HTML markup code, and all
          can include WP shortcodes. </p>
        <p>Important: You almost certainly will need to provide CSS styling
          rules for these code blocks, either as in-tag style="..." rules, or by
          adding CSS rules the the Custom CSS Rules Section described above. If
          any of your styling includes <em>float</em> rules, you will almost
          certainly have to add a <code>&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;</code>
          to your inserted code. Note: Providing margin style values, including
          negative values, can be used to control the spacing before and after
          these code blocks.</p>
        <p>The areas are mostly useful for more advanced web site builders, and
          are most available only in the <em>Weaver Xtreme Plus</em> version.</p>
        <p>Each of the HTML insertion sections includes three additional options
          - Hide on the front page, and Hide on non-front pages, and a
          background color with the CSS+ option. These settings can be used to
          control where the areas are used.</p>
        <label><b><a name="HeaderInsCode" id="HeaderInsCode"></a>Header and
            Footer HTML</b></label>
        <p>You can add HTML to the <span class="code1">Header</span> and <span
            class="code1">Footer</span>
          HTML areas in the specialized Header and Footer HTML sections of the
          Header and Footer tabs. This must be HTML markup code (including WP
          shortcodes), and will be inserted into the header (#header) and footer
          (#colophon) areas. </p>
        <p>For the header, when used in combination with hiding the site title,
          header image, and the menu, you can design a completely custom header.
          You can use it for logos, better site name text - whatever. </p>
        <p>If you hide the title, image, and header, no other code is generated
          in the #branding &lt;header&gt; block (HTML 5!), so the code here can
          be a complete header replacement. You will almost certainly need to
          add some CSS style, too. </p>
        <p>You can also override the CSS <span class="css">#branding </span>rule,
          create a new <span class="css">div</span>, or use in-line styling.
          One of the most flexible capabilities of the section is the ability to
          embed WordPress shortcodes. This might be most useful for adding a
          rotating header image using a plugin such as Weaver Show Sliders.</p>
        <p>For example, assume you've installed the Weaver Show Sliders plugin,
          and have uploaded your rotating header images for the plugin to use.
          To add this slide show header image, you should first disable the
          default header image by checking the "Hide Header Image" in the <em>Main
            Options</em> tab. Then, add this code to the<em> Header HTML content</em>
          box on the Header options tab:</p>
        <p class="css">&lt;div class="aligncenter"&gt;[show_slider
          name='header-images']&lt;/div&gt;</p>
        <p>Note that the built-in <span class="css">aligncenter</span> CSS
          class will ensure the slide show is displayed properly. Without
          appropriate CSS styling, you may get unexpected placement of the
          plugin output. The <span class="css">aligncenter</span> class will
          usually do what you want.</p>
        <p><strong>Pre-Wrapper and Post-Footer Code</strong></p>
        <p>These areas are included with the free version of the theme. The HTML
          from these boxes is respectively inserted before and after the
          #wrapper &lt;div&gt;.</p>
        <p><strong>Pre-Header, Pre-Container, Pre-Comments, Post-Comments,
            Pre-Footer, Post-Footer, Pre-Sidebar</strong></p>
        <p>These areas can be used to insert HTML and shortcodes in the given
          areas of a site page. These options are available only in the Xtreme
          Plus version. Each of these areas a wrapped in an "#inject_areaname"
          &lt;div&gt;. The name is included on the admin page. In order to get
          proper display, you may have to add an extra empty &lt;div&gt; in your
          code block to clear the floats: <span class="code1">&lt;div
            style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>. You could also include
          that in a CSS rule for the respective '#inject_xxx" rule.</p>
        <h3><a name="ArchivePages" id="ArchivePages"></a>Archive-type Pages</h3>
        <p>WordPress supports several kinds of pages that are often called
          "Archive" pages. These include pages that will display different post
          archives such as by category, tag, author, or date. It also includes
          the search page. Normally, such pages will include a title that
          describes the archive page type. In the Plus version, this tab allow
          you to hide those titles.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>.category-title-label</li>
          <li>.category-archive-meta - category description</li>
          <li>.archive-title-label - general archive view - e.g., by date</li>
          <li>.author-title-label</li>
          <li>.search-results-label</li>
          <li>.tag-title-label</li>
          <li>.tag-archive-meta - tag description</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a name="BackgroundImages" id="BackgroundImages"></a>Background
          images</h3>
        <p>This page is functional in <em>Weaver Xtreme Plus</em>, and allows
          you to specify specific background images for different areas on any
          page. You can also set the appropriate repeat options. The little
          "image" icon on the right lets you open the media library browser to
          upload or pick images. (Show an image, then click "Insert into Post"
          to insert the image's address into the desired image box.) These
          images are used on a site wide basis.</p>
        <h3><a name="SEO" id="SEO"></a>SEO</h3>
        <p><em>Weaver Xtreme</em> has been carefully designed to follow the
          basic rules used by most Search Engines - it is already SEO friendly.
          The built-in SEO features are based on the development efforts of the
          WordPress design team, and are identical to those used by the standard
          WordPress themes. Some of these features include generation of proper
          site titles that are displayed in the browser's title line, as well as
          the ability to define global meta description and keyword definitions.
          And <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> generates HTML5 tags, which are further
          used by search engines to index your site. (<em>And with HTML5, it is

        <p>This tab allows you to set additional site specific options, and it

        <h2><a name="PerPage" id="PerPage"></a>Per Page and Per Post Options</h2>
        <p>One of the most powerful features Weaver provides for customizing the
          content of your site is the set of <em>Weaver Options for This Page </em>and
          <em>Weaver Options for This Post</em>. When you create or edit a Page
          or Post from the admin page, you will see one of those two areas below
          the Editor box. They contain options that will be applied to that
          specific page or post. These settings often correspond to setting you
          find on the Standard Weaver Main Options or Advanced Options pages.
          Any settings made on the per page boxes will override the standard
          settings.</p>
        <p><strong>Weaver Options for This Post</strong></p>
        <p>The per post settings allow you to control excerpts, featured image,
          and author avatar. In addition, if you mark the post as a favorite,
          the post will be displayed with a yellow star to its left on all but
          the single post full page.</p>
        <p><strong><a name="perpoststyle" id="perpoststyle"></a>Per Page/Post
            Style</strong></p>
        <p>Per Page and Post Style allows you to add CSS styling to a specific
          post or page. To add CSS, you place rules in the Per Page/Post Style
          box. Each rule should be bracketed by the usual {}'s, and you should <strong>not</strong>
          add the &lt;style&gt; and &lt;/style&gt; tags. If you want the rule to
          apply to the entire post, you would just provide the {}'s with no
          class or id name. If you are styling a specific element in the post
          (e.g., '.post-title a' for the post's title), then add the class or id
          name. (See the example below.) Weaver will automatically add a post
          specific id (in the form '#post-nnn') to the beginning of each rule
          you provide. Note that this means you cannot combine classes into one
          rule (e.g. '.class1, .class2 {style info}'). Use a separate rule for
          each class or id.</p>
        <p> For example, to put a yellow background with a border and some
          padding around the post, plus make the title italic, add the following
          CSS to the Per Post Style box:</p>
        <pre>{background-color:yellow; border:1px solid blue; padding:5px;} /* style entire post with these styles */
.post-title a {color:red; font-style:italic;} /* make the title red and italic */
    </pre>
        <p>The above rules will be prefixed with #post-nnn or .page-nnn for
          posts and pages, respectively.</p>
        <p>Here's a list of most of the elements of a post:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>.post-title - the title (this is .page-title on the post Single
            View)</li>
          <li>.post-title a - needed to change colors since the entry title is
            really a link</li>
          <li>.entry-meta - the top info line</li>
          <li>.entry-date - the date</li>
          <li>.meta-sep - the info between the info line elements</li>
          <li>.vcard - author</li>
          <li>.entry-content - the actual post content</li>
          <li>.entry-utility - the bottom info line</li>
          <li>.cat-links - category on bottom info line</li>
          <li>.comments-link - the link to comments</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you want some other styling that will be used when the particular
          post is displayed, or if you need more control, you can prefix your
          rule with a plus ('+'), and the #post-nnn will not be added. For
          example, say you are working on post 798 (remember you can see the
          post id in the per post option box) and you want to hide the featured
          image on the single page view only. Add this rule (the + will be
          removed):</p>
        <pre>+.single #page-798 .post-format {display:none;}

If you need a joined class (e.g. #post-nnn.content-single), then put a vertical bar ('|') in front of your classes.</pre>
        <p><a name="optsperpage" id="optsperpage"></a><strong>Weaver Options for
            This Page</strong></p>
        <p>The per page options box has several groups of options. The first
          option simply has a link to the Weaver <a href="#PageTemplates">Page
            Templates</a> documentation.</p>
        <p>The Per Page Options section controls display of the page's content
          title (Hide Page Title), as well as several aspects of the standard
          Header and Footer areas.</p>
        <p>The Selective Display of Widget Areas allows fine control of which
          widget areas are displayed with the page. In addition to hiding
          specific standard widget areas, you can specify one of the <a href="#PPWidgets">Per
            Page Widget Areas</a> to serve as a replacement for the standard
          Primary, Upper/Right, and Lower/Left sidebar areas; or an additional
          Top Widget area for that page. You simply add the name of one of the
          extra widget areas previously defined at the bottom of the Widget
          Areas tab.</p>
        <p>The Menu "Placeholder" option is useful if you want a top-level menu
          item that doesn't require a 'dummy page'. This can be used if you have
          a set of sub-pages on the menu that have content, but you don't want
          to create a dummy page for the top level item. When the item is
          clicked, nothing will happen.</p>
        <p>The "Hide Page on the Primary Menu" option will hide the specific
          page from the automatically generated Primary menu. If you define a
          custom Primary menu, then this option isn't really needed. This will
          not hide the page from the Page widget - you will have to use the
          exclude feature of that widget to hide the page there. One good use of
          this option is to remove obsolete pages from your primary menu, yet
          retain the page's URL so that if other sites have linked to it, there
          will still be a page there.</p>
        <p>The Settings for "<a href="#PerPostTemplate">Page with Posts Template</a>"
          is explained above.</p>
        <p><strong>Custom Fields Mechanism</strong></p>
        <p> All of the per page and per posts options are saved using the
          standard WordPress Custom Fields mechanism. (If you ever wondered what
          that was for - well, it is very useful for saving per page values for
          templates like <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> to use!) </p>
        <p>While this is a very powerful capability, and allows you incredible
          per page customization, you should be aware of one factor - these
          settings will work only with the Weaver theme. These settings are
          associated with each individual page. They are not part of your theme
          definition, and won't be saved when you use Weaver's Save/Restore tab.
          But they are saved with the page, so if you upgrade <em>Weaver Xtreme</em>,
          or even switch to an alternate theme, those settings will remain
          intact. Note that <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> changed all the internal
          names of these options, so per page and per post values you may have
          set for Weaver II will <em><strong>not</strong></em> transfer to <em>Weaver
            Xtreme</em>. And even though you can switch themes without losing
          that information, other themes won't know what to do with it, so your
          pages will most likely just display with the other theme's default
          template. You might even have to re-set each page's template after you
          go back to <em>Weaver Xtreme</em>. This all isn't bad - but you
          should know what is going on.</p>
        <p>Â </p>
        <h3><a name="ExtraPP" id="ExtraPP"></a>Extra Per Page Options</h3>
        <p> For even more advanced control on a per page basis, Weaver will
          recognize other options that you must manually define in the Edit Page
          <em>Custom Fields</em> box. These options match equivalent global
          settings found on the Advanced Options tab, but apply on a per page
          basis.</p>
        <p>Define <em>page-head-code</em>, and the value contents will be added
          to the &lt;HEAD&gt; section. This will be inserted into the
          &lt;HEAD&gt; Section after the settings in the global <em>&lt;HEAD&gt;
            Section</em> on the <em>Advanced Options</em> tab. You can include
          specific CSS rules here, but you must wrap them in a
          &lt;style&gt;...&lt;/style&gt; block.</p>
        <p>The other options match one to one with the equivalent Advanced
          Options HTML Insertion areas. For example, to add Per Page prewrapper
		  content, define a Custom Field with the name <em>prewrapper</em> and
		  a Value with the HTML you want to add. The insertion areas include:</p>
        <p> <em>prewrapper<br />

        <p>The following section has various styling hints, including
          specification of classes that can be used for custom styling.</p>
        <h3><a name="style-titles" id="style-titles"></a>Styling Titles</h3>
        <p>The <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> title options have been designed for a
          uniform appearance. There are really two kinds of titles used on pages
          - the title of the page, and the title of posts displayed on various
          pages. The default Blog page does not have a page title, and the title
          of a post displayed on the Single Page View is displayed just like a
          regular page. The informative title included on archive-like pages
          will normally be styled like Page titles, but there are options on the
          Content Areas tab to customize those.</p>
        <p>You can also customize any title on any kind of page with these
          classes:</p>
        <h4>Title for Page-like pages: (Standard Page, Attachment, 404):</h4>

          the CSS out of the &lt;head&gt; block, as well as eliminating the need
          to generate the custom CSS when the actual site page is loaded.</p>
        <p>The other option is called Development Mode. This mode supports a few
          options that might make it easier to develop the site. When it is
          enabled, Inline CSS is used which usually will avoid browser caching
          issues. The other options are explained on the option page.</p>
        <h3><a name="Shortcodes" id="Shortcodes"></a><em>Weaver Xtreme Plus</em>
          Shortcodes &amp; Features</h3>
        <p>Many of the features of <em>Weaver Xtreme Plus</em> are implemented
          via shortcodes. While the settings and information about the Xtreme
          Plus Shortcodes are found on the <span class="code1">Appearanceâ†’Shortcodes</span>
          menu, this admin tab functions much like the WordPress "Installed
          Plugins" tab - it is mainly used to enable and disable the various
          plugins.</p>
        <p>In general, <em>Weaver Xtreme</em>'s shortcodes work very much like
          regular plugins. And like them, there is a small overhead when a site
          page is loaded. When a shortcode is disabled, it is the same as
          deactivating a plugin, and any overhead of using the shortcode will be
          eliminated. So, ideally, just as you deactivate plugins you're not
          using, you can disable any Xtreme Plus Shortcode you don't need. The
          savings will be very small, but for busy sites, it might make a small
          difference.</p>
        <h2><a name="SaveRestore" id="SaveRestore"></a>Save/Restore Themes and
          Backups</h2>
        <p><em>Weaver Xtreme</em> allows you to save a backup of all your
          settings in the WordPress database, or to download and upload them to
          a file on your own computer.</p>
        <p>Â </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Download All Current Settings</strong> - If you download
            all your settings to a backup (and this <em>includes</em> "Save
            Settings to Database"), then <em>every setting</em> is saved to a
            file with a .wxb extension.<br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li><strong>Download Only Theme Related Settings </strong>- If you
            download the current theme related settings to your computer, then
            the settings <em>relevant to a theme</em> are saved in a file with
            a ".wxt" extension. Settings that are considered "per-site" (like
            customize headers, showing excerpts, and others) are not saved or
            restored from a theme ".wxt" file.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>What is the difference between the two?</strong></p>
        <p>You might ask what the difference between a Backup and a Theme
          Setting is. The difference is that when you save a theme's settings,
          settings that apply to a particular site aren't saved. This allows
          people to share their theme designs. Most people won't care about
          sharing their theme design - they will be using it just for their own
          site. So unless you know you're going to be sharing a theme, stick to
          Backup or Save Settings on the Save/Restore tab.</p>
        <p>You should note that if you make changes to the settings, they are
          saved in the "current" settings. If you then pick another Weaver
          subtheme, for example, many of your settings will be lost and replaced
          with the new theme settings (per-site settings are not replaced when
          you change a subtheme, but ARE replaced when you use "Restore Settings
          from Database"). Thus, you really need to save your work if you want
          to be able to restore it.</p>
        <p>The simplest way to save the settings is to save them to "Save
          Settings to Database". The settings are saved in the WordPress data
          base. These settings will survive theme and WordPress upgrades, and as
          long as you're only using one theme, is perhaps the easiest way to
          save your work.</p>
        <p>For each of these save methods, there is a corresponding way to
          restore your settings.</p>
        <h2><a name="PageTemplates" id="PageTemplates"></a>Weaver Page Templates</h2>
        <p>Weaver provides you with several additional page templates for
          creating static pages. Users of the previous Weaver version should
          note that because of the new, flexible sidebar layout options, the
          need for several page templates is no longer needed or provided.<br />
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><em>Default</em> - The default template uses the standard page
            formatting defined by your settings. The default sidebar layout will
            use the standard Static Page layout, but you can use the Per Page
            options to override the default layout.<br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li><em>Blank</em> - Provides a totally blank content area inside the
            #wrapper div. (This means the page will match the overall look of
            your site.) It lets you provide totally custom HTML on a page. It
            doesn't show the page title you set when creating the page. It does
            show page top and bottom widget areas and comments unless you
            explicitly hide them on a per page basis. You can optionally hide
            the header and footer areas using the check boxes on the per page
            options. This template is good for entering raw HTML using the HTML
            editor tab. This page will use the default widget areas for a
            standard page, but this can be overridden in the per page options.<br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li><em>Raw</em> - This is an even more "bare-bones" version of Blank.
            Instead of being wrapped in the #container and #content classes, the
            post's content will be wrapped in a &lt;div&gt; named '#page-raw'.
            There will be no additional styling on the #page-raw, so the content
            won't have any margins or padding as defined by the normal
            #container or #content divs, but will instead have the
            margins/padding of the #wrapper. There will be none of the normal
            sidebars or widget areas displayed, nor are any of the HTML
            insertion areas included.<br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li><em>Two Column Content</em> - Allows you to create a content page
            with two columns of content using the standard &lt;!--more--&gt;
            page tag (entered using the page break icon from the Visual Editor).
            If you break the content into more than two areas, they will
            automatically be placed vertically (in other words, you can use more
            than one &lt;!--more--&gt; tag.<br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li><em> iframe, full content width</em> - This template is designed
            especially for using an iframe external site embed on a regular
            static page. If you have an old site in HTML that you don't want to
            convert to WordPress, or some other site you want to take on the
            appearance of your site, then this is the page template for you. It
            hides the standard page title so the external site can take the full
            page space. You can enable comments, if you wish. Use the Per Page
            options to select a sidebar layout - most likely "none".<br />
            The easiest way to add an iframe is with the <a href="#sciframe">[iframe]
              shortcode</a>. Or you can also embed an external site by simply
            adding an iframe HTML command to your page:<br />
            <span class="style4">&lt;iframe src="http://example.com"
              style="width:100%;height:600px;border: 0px"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; </span><br />
            (You'll need to use the "HTML" page editor view to add this command,
            and you can include other content as well for titles or introduction
            material.) You can adjust the height to best display the external
            page, as well as the width if you want. The page will continue to
            fill the full width even if you change the overall site width. While
            this template is designed for using iframes, it really can be used
            however you like - kind of like the Blank Content Area template, but
            allowing comments.<br />
            <br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li><em>Page with Posts</em> - When used with no options set, this
            page will display all your posts exactly the same way as the default
            blog post page. When used in the default mode, the main use for this
            feature would be to hide the Home menu item, and put your posts on a
            page with your own title. (You can hide the title from the page
            using the Per Page options.) But what is really great is that you
            can create a <a href="#PerPostTemplate">filter</a> which controls
            just which posts will be displayed - specific categories, for
            example.<br />
            <br />
            Because these are in fact true static pages with automatic inclusion
            of filtered posts, you can enter whatever content you want in the
            content edit box, and that content will appear above the posts that
            are displayed.<br />
            <br />
            The "Page with Posts" template options won't be displayed in the per
            page box until after you've selected the "Page with Posts" template
            in the Page Attributes box, and saved the draft or published the
            page.<br />
            <br />
            Then you will get the <a href="#PerPostTemplate">options needed to
              filter</a> the posts to display, as well as options to control how
            the posts are displayed (full, excerpts, title only). You can also
            display the posts in 1, 2, or 3 columns. In the previous version of
            Weaver, each of these options was implemented as a separate page
            template instead of a simple per page option.<br />
            <br />
            While the Page with Posts template allows you to easily display
            posts on a page, you can also add posts to any static page using the
            [show_posts] shortcode for even more fine-tuned control. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li><em>Sitemap</em> - This page template will display a simple
            sitemap, consisting of a list of all ages, monthly post archives,
            all categories, and the tag cloud. You can add content to the page
            that will appear above the sitemap. See<a href="#TweakSiteMap">
              Tweaking the SiteMap page template</a> for a description of
            tweaking the SiteMap.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Other options for creating custom pages</strong></p>
        <p>You can provide additional customization for a given page using the <a
            href="#ExtraPP">Extra
            Per Page Options</a> described below. For example, creating an
          entire custom header can be accomplished by checking the "Hide Entire
          Header" per page option, and including a Custom Field called
          "preheader" that has the code for the custom header.</p>
        <p>Any page can be made into a one full column page simply by setting
          the "No sidebars, one column content" sidebar layout in the per page
          option box.</p>
        <h3><a name="PerPostTemplate" id="PerPostTemplate"></a>Settings for
          "Page with Posts" Template </h3>
        <p> One of the most powerful features of the Page with Posts template is
          that it allows you to create filters on a <a href="#PerPage">per page</a>
          basis that lets you display specific posts on a page. You can have as
          many different pages using the Page with Posts template as you need,
          all showing a different set of posts.</p>
        <p>The standard items you can use in your filter include: Category,
          Tags, Single Page, Order by, Sort Order, Author, Custom Post Type, and
          number of posts to display. The Order by, Sort Order, and Posts per
          Page are explained on the Weaver Options for This Page form. The
          Category, Tags, and Single Page options are based on slugs. As a rule,
          if you include values in more than one box, they will be combined, and
          the posts displayed will meet all the criteria you specified.</p>
        <p>For example, say you have defined the categories 'Cat A', 'Cat B',
          and 'News' (among others, perhaps). These categories will have the
          slugs 'cat-a', 'cat-b', and 'news'. You can see the slug names if you
          open the <em>Posts-&gt;Categories</em> admin page. The same is true
          for tags. So, to display a list of posts from a specific set of
          categories and/or tags, you simply enter a list of one or more slugs
          you want included, separated by commas.</p>
        <p>The Categories list has an extra feature. If you add a '-' (minus
          sign) to the front of a category slug (e.g., <em>-uncategorized</em>),
          then all the posts from that category will be excluded. So if you
          placed <em>-uncategorized</em> in the <em>Category</em> box, then
          only posts that have a category other than Uncategorized will be
          displayed.</p>
        <p>Note: Because of what might be described as a quirk in how WordPress
          handles category filtering, if you specify specific categories <strong>to</strong>
          show (as opposed <strong>to not</strong> show), then sticky posts
          won't be displayed at the front with special formatting. They are
          displayed in their normal sort order. You can also see this behavior
          if you look at a category archive page, for example. Unfortunately,
          there seems to be no work around for this strangeness. So if you have
          a page that you want to display specific categories that include
          sticky posts, then you have to exclude all other categories rather
          than include the categories you do want to show.</p>
        <p>The "Page with Posts" per page options also let you set how the posts
          are displayed: Full post, Excerpt, Title Only, and number of columns.
          You can also selectively hide the meta info lines.</p>
        <h3><a name="TweakSiteMap" id="TweakSiteMap"></a>Tweaking the SiteMap
          page template</h3>
        <p>The SiteMap will display any content you add to the Page Content from
          the Page Editor at the top. This can be left blank. It will also
          automatically show five other sections: List of all site pages, List
          of all posts by month, list of posts by Categories, list of posts by
          Tag cloud, and list of posts by Author.</p>
        <p>You can specify a comma separated list of Page IDs to be excluded
          from the SiteMap page on the<em> Advanced Options : Site Options</em>
          tab. (To exclude pages from Search results, use a plugin such as
          "Search Exclude".)</p>
        <p> You can also hide any of the specific sections of the SiteMap by
          adding rules to the "Custom CSS Rules" box. To hide authors, for
          example, add the ruleÂ <span class="css">#sitemap-authors{display:none;}</span>.
          The IDs for the SiteMap sections are:Â <span class="css">#sitemap-pages,
            #sitemap-posts, #sitemap-categories, #sitemap-tags, #sitemap-authors</span>.</p>
        <p>In addition to using the five different SiteMap section IDs to hide
          them, you could also add other rules such as borders, colors, etc. to
          provide a custom styled Site Map.</p>
        <h2><a name="editstyling" id="editstyling"></a>Post/Page Editor Styling</h2>
        <p><em>Weaver Xtreme</em> adds style settings for the tinyMCE editor
          used whenever you edit a page or post. The colors and font information
          for your text, headings, images, and tables will now closely match the
          values you've set for your theme.</p>
        <p>For the most part, the layout presented in the Page/Post editor will
          very closely match the final page. However, the match is not always
          perfect. Changing the font or theme width can cause a mismatch. In
          addition, the width is determined by the default layout for a default
          static page, and if your blog post pages doesn't use the standard page
          layout, the editor width will not match. </p>
        <p>There are a couple of other caveats. Weaver allows you to style your
          page content and post content a little differently. The Page/Post
          editor does not distinguish between the two types of content, so you
          will see Page styling for both pages and posts. </p>
        <p>Technical Note: The occasional mismatch of the Editor view and the
          final display of your content is caused by differences in how the
          tinyMCE editor determines the style it uses to display content. It is
          also related to the fact that tinyMCE doesn't have full access to the
          theme settings (it is a different dashboard menu selection).
          Ultimately, the final look of your pages depends on the browser used
          to view the pages.</p>
        <h2><a name="raw_html" id="raw_html"></a>Entering Raw HTML and Scripts</h2>
        <p>A not commonly known feature of the WordPress page and post editor is
          the significant amount of automatic formatting and filtering it does.
          It will automatically add paragraph tags, it will "texturize" content
          by changing quote marks to "curly" quotes and others, it adds smiley
          graphics, and does some other automatic character conversions. This
          automatic formatting happens even if you use the HTML view. The HTML
          view will allow you to add some HTML markup, but the auto-paragraph
          filtering still happens.</p>
        <p>Sometimes you just need to enter HTML markup, and even JavaScript
          code, and have the page look exactly how you want it to. You might
          have HTML from another site or page you've created somewhere else.
          Weaver has a per page and per post option called "Allow Raw HTML and
          scripts." If you check this option, your page content will not be
          filtered. Shortcodes are still processed. This option also disables
          the Visual editor. If you were to switch between the HTML and Visual
          editor views, your carefully crafted HTML code will be altered.</p>
        <p>If you check the "Disable Visual Editor" option, the Visual editor
          will be disabled, and your simple HTML will be left alone, but the
          auto-paragraph and other filtering will still happen.</p>
        <h2><a name="post_formats" id="post_formats"></a>Post Formats</h2>
        <p>Beginning with WordPress Version 3.1, a new feature has been added to
          the Edit Post screen - Format. Weaver supports several additional Post
          Formats over the Standard one. You may find the Post Formats useful.
          Posts with a Format specified will display a "pre-title" showing the
          Format. This helps these posts stand out. The descriptions for each
          Post Format describe how the post will be displayed from the blog
          pages. Archive pages display the post as an excerpt, but with the
          Format type's titles. These Post Formats were modeled after Twenty
          Eleven.</p>
        <p><a name="format_aside" id="aside"><strong>Aside</strong></a></p>
        <p>The Aside Format is intended to display a short note from the author.
          This Format does not display the post title or category info, and puts
          the date and author at the bottom.</p>
        <p><a name="gallerypost" id="gallerypost"></a><strong>Gallery Post
            Format</strong></p>
        <p> If you check this for a post, Weaver will display this as a Gallery.
          When displayed on the blog page, a Gallery Format Post will display as
          a special excerpt that shows one thumbnail from all the images
          included from the Media Library. If the user clicks on the image, they
          will be taken to the full post with all the images.</p>
        <p><a name="format_link" id="format_link"></a><strong>Link</strong></p>
        <p>The Link Format is intended to display links. It will be displayed
          like the Aside, but with Link as the title.</p>
        <p><a name="format_quote" id="format_quote"></a><strong>Quote</strong></p>
        <p>The Quote Format is intended for quotations. (For the language
          sticklers, this should be called Quotation, but Quote is the name
          used.). It works like any other post, but with a "Quote" pre-title.</p>
        <p><a name="format_status" id="format_status"></a><strong>Status</strong></p>
        <p>The Status Format is intended for a short status update from the
          author. It displays like an Aside, but also add the Author's avatar to
          the post. </p>
        <h2><a name="CustomMenus" id="CustomMenus"></a></h2>
        <p>Â </p>
        <p>WordPress allows you to define custom menus. By using the <span class="code1">Appearance-&gt;Menus</span>
          panel, you can create a menu completely under your control. <em>Weaver
            Xtreme</em> allows you to define two custom menus to be used with
          the main menu bars. If you have defined two custom menus, they will be
          placed above and below the site header image. (You can also define
          other custom menus for use with <em>Weaver Xtreme Plus</em> extra
          menus, as well as the custom menu widget.)</p>
        <p>Custom Menus can let you really customize site navigation. One
          typical use of multiple menus is one for pages, the other organized by
          category or tags. But you have complete control. However, which menus
          show can be a bit confusing. There are three specific cases of
          specifying menus that are most likely to be useful:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>No Custom Menus Defined</strong><br />
            This might be the most common case. If you don't use the <em>Menus</em>
            panel, and don't define any custom menus, then the theme will
            automatically generate a menu based on your pages (including Home)
            using the page order defined in the page editor when you create
            pages. This is the legacy method, and works fine for many
            situations.<br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li><strong>Defining One or Two Custom Menus</strong><br />
            You can also define one or two custom menus. The two menus supported
            by Weaver are called the Primary and Secondary Menus. If you define
            a Primary Menu, then it will be the main menu bar normally under the
            Header Image. If you don't define a Secondary menu, then only one
            will be displayed. If you define the Secondary Menu, then it will
            normally be displayed above the Header Image. You can switch the
            order of the two menus either using the <em>Main Options</em> tab,
            or by switching the order in the <em>Menus</em> panel.<br />
            <br />
            Normally, both menu bars will use the same menu bar color scheme.
            When you've selected the rounded area option, the top menu bar will
            have the top edge rounded, and the bottom menu bar the lower edge
            rounded. This looks great with a square Header Image.<br />
            <br />
            You can use CSS snippets to change the color of the Secondary menu
            bar - it uses <span class="css">#access2</span> for its CSS tags.<br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li><strong>Define Only Secondary Custom Menu</strong><br />
            If you define only the Secondary Menu and leave the Primary
            Navigation theme location blank, then Weaver will display two menu
            bars - the Secondary Menu bar on top as you defined, and the default
            menu with pages (as discussed in #1 above) on the bottom menu bar.<br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li><strong>Define Other Menus for <em>Weaver Xtreme Plus</em></strong><br />
            <em>Weaver Xtreme Plus</em> includes an "Extra Menus" shortcode.
            While the previous explanation about the Primary and Secondary menus
            is true, you can really define as many menus as you want or need.
            You can then use the extra menu names for <em>Weaver Xtreme Plus</em>'s
            extra menus.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3><a name="custom-messages" id="custom-messages"></a>Custom User
          Interface Messages</h3>
        <p>A request we often get is the ability to customize user interface
          messages such as "Reply", "Previous/Next Post", and others. Weaver
          Xtreme now provides the ability to do this using standard WordPress
          filters. This section will list all the available filters to modify
          User Interface messages.</p>
        <p>Note that some values, such as the "Continue Reading" message already
          have a built-in option due to popular demand. These messages can be
          changed either with a filter, or using the option.</p>
        <p>These filters can't be added directly by<em> Weaver Xtreme</em>, but
          are easily added using the new <em>Weaver Xtreme </em>&lt;HEAD&gt;
          Section <strong>Actions and Filters</strong> option provided by the <em>Weaver
            Xtreme Plus</em> plugin.</p>
        <p> For example, to replace the built in Older/Newer Blog Navigation
          messages, add these filters to the<strong> Actions and Filters</strong>
          box:</p>
        <p class="code1">/* Add filters to change the Older Blog Navigation
          messages */<br />
          add_filter('weaverx_older_posts','wx_older_posts');<br />
          function wx_older_posts($older) {<br />
          Â Â Â Â return 'Back!';<br />
          }<br />
        </p>
        <p>The original message, including wrapping HTML for many strings, will
          be passed in to the filter using the single parameter. You can return
          whatever string you want, including your own HTML wrapping and
          styling. You have total flexibility in what message comes out. You
          would define similar filters for any of the following defined <em>Weaver
            Xtreme</em> filters.</p>
        <p>Filters labeled with (%s) mean that the subject of the title (mostly
          archive page titles) will be used in place of the %s. If you want the
          extra title info, then you need to include the %s in your filter
          replacement. Technically, the title uses sprintf to add the specific
          information to the main title. For example, the tag archive default
          title is "Tag Archives: %s". The tag name will be filled in to the %s
          position - "Tag Archives: Post Formats".</p>
        <p>If you don't know PHP programming, join the crowd! But it isn't that
          hard to simply use the above example to create your own custom message
          text for the various elements described in the list below. For
          example, suppose you want to change the text on the "Post Comment"
          button for comments. It is a pretty easy 4 step process - you can
          repeat for any of the filters listed below changing to appropriate
          names.</p>
        <ol>
          <li> Copy the above example into the Actions and Filters box.</li>
          <li> Change the 'weaverx_older_posts' to 'weaverx_post_comment_form'.</li>
          <li> Change the 'wx_older_posts' to 'wx_post_comment_form'. </li>
          <li>Finally, change the 'Back!' to whatever you want.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>User interface message filters supported</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>'weaverx_older_posts', 'weaverx_newer_posts' - replace the
            Older/Newer and Previous/Next Blog Navigation Style for navigating
            blog posts.</li>
          <li>'weaverx_more_message' - the Continue Reading message (already has
            built-in option)</li>
          <li>'weaverx_tag_archives' - page title for tag archives (%s)</li>

            replaced by number of replies) (blog page version)</li>
          <li>'weaverx_leave_reply_form' - Leave a Reply message on comment form</li>
          <li>'weaverx_cancel_reply_form' - Cancel Reply message on comment form</li>
          <li>'weaverx_post_comment_form' - Post Comment button on comment form</li>
          <li>'weaverx_site_title' - The site title</li>
          <li>'weaverx_tagline' - Site tagline</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The strings associated with the Post top and bottom Meta information
          lines are not suitable for this type of filtering due to some
          technical limitations. The <em>Weaver Xtreme Plus</em> plugin
          provides the Custom Post Info Lines option to create custom wording
          and layout for these lines.</p>
        <h3><a name="plugins" id="plugins"></a>Built-in Support for Other
          Plugins</h3>
        <p>Weaver includes built-in support for a few plugins available from
          WordPress.org. These plugins have been tested, and work well with
          Weaver.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>WP PageNavi</strong> - This popular plugin adds a page
            numbered navigation menu for your blog posts. It normally requires
            modification to code, plus some extra CSS styling. Now you can
            simply install and activate WP PageNavi, and your site will feature
            page number navigation. (Note - while <em>Weaver Xtreme</em>
            continues to provide automatic support for WP PageNavi, its
            functionality is largely duplicated by the new built-in <em>Weaver
              Xtreme</em> Info Bar feature.) The default styling creates menus
            that work with existing Weaver subthemes, but you can still use WP
            PageNavi options to fine tune its appearance, and add custom styling
            for the <span class="style4">.wp-pagenavi</span> rules (see
            wp-pagenavi documentation about its rules) to the Advanced Options
            &lt;HEAD&gt; section if needed.<br />
            <br />
            PageNavi menus can be displayed a the top, bottom, or combination on
            your post pages. You can add the following rules to the &lt;HEAD&gt;
            Section of advanced options to control where the PageNavi menus are
            displayed:<br />
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>Not at top on first page, include at top on subsequent pages:
                default behavior</li>
              <li>Always show at top: <span class="style4">#nav-above
                  {display:block !important;}</span></li>
              <li>Never at top: <span class="style4">#nav-above {display:none
                  !important;}</span></li>
              <li>Always on bottom: default behavior</li>
              <li>Never on bottom: <span class="style4">#nav-below
                  {display:none !important;}</span> </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            You can also control the position of the PageNavi menu by adding
            these rules to the &lt;HEAD&gt; Section: <br />
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>Left: default</li>
              <li>Center: <span class="style4">.wp-pagenavi
                  {text-align:center;}</span></li>
              <li>Right: <span class="style4">.wp-pagenavi {float:right;} </span>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            (<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-pagenavi/">WP-PageNavi</a>)<br />

          <li><strong>Woocommerce</strong><br />
            <br />
            <em>Weaver Xtreme Plus</em> provides excellent support for
            Woocommerce. By default, Woocommerce generated pages will behave
            just like a standard default static page. This includes using
            sidebars in the default page layout. Sometimes, this is not what you
            might want. There a few simple CSS rules you can add to the <em>Weaver
              Xtreme</em> <em>Advanced Options -&gt; Custom CSS Rules</em> box
            to hide the sidebars, and instead display the Woocommerce pages as a
            single column, full width page. You can refine the basic rules to
            cover different types of Woo pages.<br />
            <br />
            <strong>Display all Woocommerce pages as single column page</strong>:<br />
            <br />
            <pre class="codebox">.woocommerce-page #sidebar_wrap_left,
    .woocommerce-page #sidebar_wrap_right {
   display:none ;
}
.woocommerce-page #container {
    width:100%;
}
</pre> <strong>Display Woocommerce Shop page as single column:</strong><br />
            <br />
            Start with above code, but replace <span class="css">.woocommerce-page</span>
            with <span class="css">.post-type-archive-product</span><br />
            <br />
            <strong>Display Cart as single column:</strong><br />
            <br />
            Replace<span class="css"> .woocommerce-page</span> with <span class="css">.woocommerce-cart</span><br />
            <br />
            <strong>Display Checkout related pages as single column:</strong><br />
            <br />
            Replace <span class="css">.woocommerce-page</span> with <span class="css">.woocommerce-checkout</span></li>
        </ol>
        <h3><a name="quickcache" id="quickcache"></a>Compatible Caching Plugins</h3>
        <p>We highly recommend Quick Cache. We like how clean and easy to use
          Quick Cache is. Its free version works for most people, and it also
          has a Pro version with some features important to some advanced users.
          Quick Cache will improve your site's speed as much as any other
          caching plugin for a lot less hassle.</p>
        <p>Since <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> is totally responsive, any other
          WordPress cache plugin, as well as external caching sites like

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Things you can't do</strong><br />
            While <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> offers unparalleled flexibility, it
            still has a "hard-wired" HTML layout, with the order of some
            sections in a required layout. See the Weaver HTML &lt;div&gt;
            Hierarchy section to see this layout.<br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li><strong>Wording of User Text</strong><br />
            The wording of the end User (site visitor) messages is fixed (e.g.,
            Posted on, Previous Post, etc.). This is due to internationalization
            issues. <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> includes translation files for over
            20 languages. (This is the visitor side only - the Admin interface
            is likely to remain in English for the foreseeable future because of
            its complexity and lengthy help messages.) <br />
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="language_support" id="language_support"></a>Using Weaver in
          your language</h2>
        <p><em>Weaver Xtreme</em> is distributed with translation files for over
          20 world languages which will automatically be used if your site has
          been set up properly for your language. Beyond that, WordPress and
          Twenty Eleven have translations available for many languages that can
          serve as a base for making a new <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> translation.</p>
        <p>If you need to make your site display in a language other than
          English, the place to start is the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress_in_Your_Language">Installing
            WordPress in Your Language</a> page at WordPress.org. You have to
          install both the WordPress translations for your language, plus the <em>theme</em>
          translations. But since Twenty Eleven is the current standard theme,
          its translations should be automatically included when you install
          WordPress for your language. Because Weaver visitor side wording is
          based on a combination of the default Twenty Eleven theme and standard
          WordPress messages, those two translation files can serve as a basis
          for creating a new visitor side translation for <em>Weaver Xtreme</em>
          beyond those already included.</p>
        <p>The Weaver admin panel, on the other hand, is still strictly English
          - it is has so much help and explanations, that it would be very
          difficult to translate. But the important part is that you can use the
          existing language translation files for Twenty Eleven and WordPress
          with Weaver to create a new translation file so that people who visit
          your site will see your native language.</p>
        <p> Here's what you need to do. The goal is to download three files from
          your site to your own computer, use a free tool called Poedit to
          create the translation, and then upload the translation back to your
          site. You may need to use your site's host control panel interface
          (e.g., cPanel), or use your ftp access. Here are the steps. </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Down load <em>Weaver Xtreme</em>'s .pot translation file. It is
            found at <span class="css">/wp-content/themes/weaver-xtreme/languages/weaverx.
              pot.</span> After you have downloaded it to your own computer,
            rename it to reflect your local language - for example, <span class="css">es_ES.po</span>
            if you were doing a Spanish version (that's already been done, but
            we will use es_ES for the rest of our examples). This file will
            become the main translation file you will eventually re-upload to
            your site.</li>
          <li>Find Twenty Eleven's language directory. It will usually be at "<span
              style="font-family: courier new,courier;">/your-site-root-directory/wp-content/themes/twentyeleven/languages</span>".
            That directory contains the Twenty Eleven language files. Once your
            site has been installed for your language, that directory should
            contain 2 or 3 files (perhaps more). Two of those files will match
            your language setting. For example, if you have installed the
            Spanish version of WordPress, you'll find <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">es_ES.po</span>
            and <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">es_ES.mo</span>
            there. Download the <span class="css">es_ES.po</span> (use your own
            language equivalent) file to your computer, but rename it to
            something like es_ES-2011.po so you can tell it apart from the other
            files.</li>
          <li>Now find the WordPress main language file. It will be found at <span
              class="css">/wp-content/languages/es_ES.po</span>.
            Again, download that file to your computer, using your language, and
            renaming it (for example, <span class="css">es_ES-wp.po</span>) so
            you don't mix it up with the other two files.</li>
          <li>You should now have three files on you computer - <em>Weaver
              Xtreme</em>'s <span class="css">weaverx.pot</span> renamed to <span
              class="css">es_ES.po</span>,
            and the two files from WordPress - <span class="css">es_ES-2011.po</span>
            and <span class="css">es_ES-wp.po</span>.</li>
          <li>Now download Poedit from <span class="css">http://www.poedit.net</span>
            - it has versions for both Mac and Windows. This will serve as your
            main tool.</li>
          <li>Open the main <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> <span class="css">es_ES.po</span>
            file. It should contain all the visitor side strings (about 100 of
            them), but no translation. The goal will be to find the translations
            from the other two files, and copy/paste them into the <em>Weaver
              Xtreme</em> file.</li>
          <li>Open each of the other files, <span class="css">es_ES-2011.po</span>
            and <span class="css">es_ES-wp.po</span> in new Poedit windows.
            These files will have a bunch of strings with both the English and
            the translated versions.</li>
          <li>Here's the procedure:
            <ul>
              <li>Click on the first untranslated string in the Weaver version.
                This will be displayed in the top one of two boxes on the bottom
                of Poedit. The top one is English, the bottom one (should be
                empty now) the translated version.</li>
              <li>In the English box at the bottom, select the entire string,
                and copy it. (You'll want to learn the short cut key for select
                all, copy, and paste - usually <em>cmd-A</em>, <em>cmd-C</em>,
                and <em>cmd-V</em> - where cmd is the appropriate key for Mac
                or Windows).</li>
              <li>Now switch to the Poedit window that has the 2011 version of
                the translation - most of the strings will be found in that
                file, but some are still in the WP file. Enter the Find command
                (cmd-F), and paste the original English string into the find
                pattern. This will find the translated string. If you don't find
                it in the 2011 version, search for it in the WP version. This
                will work for all strings except a couple involving RSS, which
                you can usually just use RSS as the translation.</li>
              <li>Now select and copy the translation from the 2011 or WP bottom
                window, and move to the Weaver window. You can now paste that
                translation into the bottom box on the Weaver Poedit window.</li>
              <li>Repeat about 100 times for each string. This can be done in 20
                or 30 minutes, usually.</li>
              <li>If you can't find a string, feel free to provide your own
                translation.</li>
              <li>Save you work often. Whenever you save, Poedit will create
                both a .po and a .mo version of the translation files.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Finally, upload the new <span class="css">es_ES.po</span> and <span
              class="css">es_ES.mo</span>
            created by Poedit to your <span class="css">/wp-content/themes/weaverx/languages/</span>
            directory. Your visitor side translations should be automatically
            used now.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You can use this procedure to edit an existing file as well if you
          want to create a different translation. You can even use this
          technique to create alternate wordings for any visitor side message,
          even for the English version.</p>
        <p>If you create a new translation, please send it to us, and we will
          include it in future versions of <em>Weaver Xtreme</em>.</p>
        <h2><a name="ie" id="ie"></a>Internet Explorer Compatibility</h2>
        <p>Microsoft's Internet Explorer has varying native compatibility with
          Weaver, sometimes depending on what other plugins you are using with
          your site. IE 11 finally seems to be standards compliant, and seem to
          work perfectly with Weaver. Versions previous to IE 9 have various
          incompatibilities that have been solved with a special script included
          with Weaver that works on almost all IE 8 sites.</p>
        <p><em>Weaver Xtreme</em> will define special IE CSS classes's for IE 8
          to IE 9: .ie8, and .ie9. Versions before IE 8 are not supported by
          WordPress, and thus not by Weaver. IE 10 and later no longer support
          "Conditional Comments", and thus there is <strong>no</strong> .ie10
          or later. Supposedly this means that IE believes it is 100% compatible
          with other browsers.</p>
        <p>There are two main incompatibilities with pre-IE 9 versions. First,
          IE8 does not support rounded corners or shadows. These are not
          supported for IE8 by <em>Weaver Xtreme</em>. But Weaver does provide
          appropriate "polyfills" for other required support - such as @media,
          HTML5 elements, and rem.</p>
        <h2><a name="TechNotes" id="TechNotes"></a>Technical Notes</h2>
        <p>The <em>Weaver X</em> theme was derived from our Aspen Theme, which
          was derived from Weaver II, which was derived from Weaver - originally
          derived from the Twenty Eleven default theme. Many of the features
          used by Weaver are were influenced by Twenty Eleven. Most
          significantly, this includes the use of HTML5 and the architecture of
          the theme's php files. <em>Weaver Xtreme</em>, however, has has
          almost all the code that generates output essentially totally
          re-written. Only the Admin interface code was reused in any
          significant way.</p>
        <h3><a name="EUCookies" id="EUCookies"></a>EU/UK Cookie Compliance</h3>
        <p>Note for EU/UK users. <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> uses cookies on two
          occasions. The first is to control the active admin tabs in the <em>Weaver
            Xtreme</em> Admin interface. The second is to determine the
          Mobile/Full view state on mobile devices. Neither of these cookies
          contain any information of a personal nature. These cookies would
          likely qualify as SESSION cookies.</p>
        <p>There are several WordPress plugins available so your site can comply
          with EU/UK cookie laws. <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> has no official
          recommendation or claim that its use of cookies does or does not
          require EU/UK cookie consent forms.</p>
        <h2><a name="divhierarchy" id="divhierarchy"></a>Weaver HTML &lt;div&gt;
          Hierarchy</h2>
        <p>The Weaver theme generates content that is wrapped in HTML
          &lt;div&gt;'s with a set of conventional names. A typical site page
          will have the following hierarchy. Knowing this can help you make
          additional custom modifications. (Another useful thing to do is to use
          the "View Document Source" option of your web browser to see the
          actual HTML generated by WordPress for your site content.) This
          example is a standard page with a Right Sidebar layout. The locations
          of the sidebar areas will differ for different layouts. Moving the
          menu by options will change where it is located. (<em>Important note:
            the names and order of these &lt;div&gt;'s have changed
            significantly since Weaver II!</em>)</p>

        <h3><a name="switch-wii" id="switch-wii"></a>Switching from Weaver II</h3>
        <p>It is important to remember that <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> is a
          significant re-design of Weaver II. While it is possible to duplicate
          almost everything Weaver II can do, <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> has a
          significantly altered &lt;div&gt; layout, and has changed many of the
          id's, class names, and option names.</p>
        <p>We have created a couple of plugins to help with the conversion, both
          free, and both available at WordPress.org. The first is the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/weaver-ii-to-weaver-xtreme/"
            title="Weaver II to Weaver Xtreme converter"
            target="_blank">Weaver
            II To Weaver Xtreme</a> plugin. This converter will convert most <em>Weaver
            II </em>settings to compatible Weaver Xtreme settings. For those
          settings that aren't directly compatible, the converter will print a
          report that lists each incompatible setting, and often provides a
          suggestion for a manual fix. The converter also will non-destructively
          convert all you old <em>Weaver II</em> Per Page and Per Post settings
          to <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> Per Page/Post settings. The converter
          handles both <em>Weaver II</em> free and <em>Weaver II Pro</em>
          settings.</p>
        <p>The second tool is the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/weaver-themes-shortcode-compatibility/"
            title="Shortcode Compatibility"
            target="_blank">Weaver
            Themes Shortcode Compatibility</a> plugin. This plugin supports all
          but one Weaver II shortcode in any WordPress theme, most importantly
          including Weaver Xtreme. The plugin will also allow you to use Weaver
          Xtreme shortcodes on other WP themes. </p>
        <p>After conversion, you will likely want to take advantange of at least
          some of <em>Weaver Xtreme's</em> new features.</p>
        <p>The <em>Weaver Xtreme</em> design and option set is significantly
          more powerful than <em>Weaver II's.</em> Because the design is now
          more area-centric, and uses inheritance, it is, in fact, somewhat
          easier to create design with <em>Weaver Xtreme.</em> There area many
          groups of options that are essentially identical to each other - it is
          more a matter of understanding the cascading areas used by <em>Weaver
            Xtreme</em> than it is of learning every available option. </p>
        <p>One of the more significant differences is font family handling.
          Generally, you will get an equivalent look simply by setting the Font
          Family in the <span class="code1">Weaver Xtreme Main Options :
            Wrapping Areas : Wrapper Area</span> settings. But <em>Weaver
            Xtreme</em> has more (and different) font family choices that can be
          applied to any of the different areas.</p>
